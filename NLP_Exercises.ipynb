I don’t actually think about being in a new relationship. I hate that we’re broken up, I don’t want to be, I don’t want to move on, I want you back, I want us. I also know I can’t have you until I have worked some things out and both of us have had time to find forgiveness and let the anger subside. It will take months. Maybe we’ll find we don’t want anyone else but each other and maybe we’ll find we don’t belong but the point is we’ll know what it is and be confident in it. My goal in regards to us isn’t to move on and get into a new relationship and be a great boyfriend. It’s to get myself in a good place and see if there’s still a possibility for us to continue but this time the right way.\\n']\n"

       "['For free-will to exist it needs to exist in an orientation of reality that does not violate cohesion. Likely, no such orientation exists.  \\n',\n",
       " 'Prior to Einstein, physicists saw Time as a perception made up in the mind as opposed to perceiving a property of reality that we interpreted in a way that we now call Time; and so we though Time could not be manipulated and was the same for anyone in any reference frame. But speed and gravity are capable of warping the interpretation of the Time property of realty: Time space. Perhaps, we still believe that there is a mechanism of Time in our brain that is warped by moving fast or being near high gravity but then how would the brain be able to slow down body growth? So Time Gravity must exist outside of our mind and impacts every cell in our body and if there is Time Gravity then there must be a Space in which Time Gravity propagates and that is what I call Time Space. Heavy gravity warps our orientation of what is Space relative to other people; gravity has rotated our 4D axes, our reference frame, such that if I move left-right according to the reference frame of someone else I am actually nearly stationary and moving forward in Time because their left-right direction is my past-future direction due to gravity rotating the axes. So if they were to see me move they would think I am in a stand still because from my perspective they asked me to only go forward in Time, not to move in my reference frame of 3D space. If his right were my forward in Time and he asked me to move left, I would be unable to move in the direction of his left. So Gravity doesn’t warp space-time, it reorients it such that what I used to consider a direction moving through time I now think it’s moving through 3D space. So if someone sees me moving through 3D space that is aligned with their Time direction I will look like I am going either slow or faster through Time. So the paradoxes of near light speed travel or passing through heavy gravity wells could not be solved. Einstein realized however, that Time is an actual property of reality (ie space because reality is only space) whether we are alive or not. Time is not an illusion we project into reality, it’s an interpretation of something real that is separate but cohesive with 3D space. So Einstein was the first to understand Time as a space dimension. When he realized this, he also realized that reality which now includes time is specific to the observers reference frame. For example, we know that 3D space is relative to an observer’s reference frame. Example, if you asked two people who were on opposite sides of the Earth’s surface which way was up they would point in opposite directions and this is an effect cause by their orientation in reality and gravity and the shape of the earth. Now, since Time is now also part of reality and not made up in our head then Time is also a space dimension and so it is an observed part of reality and since it is observed it is subject to the reference frame of the person observing, in other words, to their beliefs of their orientation in reality. For example, if the universe were a 4D sphere and two people were on opposite sides of the surface of the universe and you asked them to point toward which direction is forward in Time they would point in opposite directions; each person would point to their future but that would be the past direction to the other. Because Einstein realized this, he then was able to propose that the observers orientation is capable of forcing an interpretation of moving slower in Time relative to the person not moving or not in a gravity well. Similarly, we believe that Emotion is something that we perceive in our mind rather than a new dimension of space/reality that is interacting with our physical existence that our brains have learned to interpret as what we call emotion. For example, Time has always impacted a rock, but a rock was unaware of the existence of Time because it doesn’t have a brain to additionally interpret the impact. Time is also impacting our physical existence everywhere just like it does to a rock and it would still impact our physical existence even if we didn’t have a brain to observe it. But we have a brain that is both impacted by Time Gravity AND can observe the impact. We are being pushed in a direction through Time space just like we are being pushed downward by spatial gravity. Also, just like a rock is being impacted by spatial gravity, our physical bodies are being impacted by spatial gravity including our brains but our brains are capable of observing this impact and the orientation of reality it imposes on us. The Earth is pulling us in a certain direction which obscures the arbitrary orientations of reality and provides the unique, singular definition of UP vs DOWN distinctly separate from Right vs Left and Forward vs Backward which remain arbitrary to us. Similarly, there must be a Time object, call it a 4D sphere on which the Universe stands and so the entire physical universe is subjected to its gravity, Time Gravity, obscuring the arbitrariness of a particular dimension of reality. Note, 4D is cohesive so the Earth is actually a 4D sphere but we are oriented in reality such that the 4D dimension of Earth does not exist in what we call 3D space but if we were to change our orientation of what we call 3D space we would see a part of Earth’s 4D surface because it would enter into our orientation of space that now interprets its 4th dimension as space and so becomes visible to us. So we are standing on the 4D surface of Earth subjected to a Time Gravity along with our brains but our brain is perceptual so we notice the effect and it wasn’t till humans that we could understand where it’s coming from. Time Gravity is pulling us through Time Space such that we believe the orientation of past-future is distinctly and inherently separate from up-down, left-right, forward-backward, but just like up-down is not inherently different from left-right and forward-backward and only appears that way because the Earth’s 3D form is pulling us down, the Earth’s 4D form is also pulling us toward it and powerfully so that we cannot even jump off its surface like we can in 3D. Our conscious has an orientation of 3D but our bodies clearly have an orientation that views 4D as cohesive space because it’s being impacted by it. So just like the rock is unaware of 3D spatial gravity and can’t jump off the surface, we are also unaware of Time gravity and can’t resist or counter its impact, ie we do not have a body that we are in conscious control over that could escape or observe what is causing time gravity; we can only experience its effects. Our 3D body and brain could be the inside of a 4D  body but that body does not have a brain, or maybe not a consciousness, or maybe not eyes, but either way because we are enclosed in this 4D cell we are unable to peer outside of it and so can’t see Time as a space dimension but we are able to see 3D because our 4D body only obscures 4D as space. But we are still impacted by the effects of 4D space even though we cannot see it. And we interpret time gravity as something that is forcing a particular direction creating a resistance response just like our muscles keep us resisting being pulled to the ground. So massive objects have an impact on Time because Time Gravity is increased: gravity is all dimensional and so it is increased in all dimensions but we orient the effects according to what we call space and what we call time. But note, we can notice the effects of stepping onto the moon because now we can jump higher. But when we step onto the moon we don’t notice that time has sped up for us relative to where we were. We when are on the moon Time and spatial gravity has decreased and so when we jump in space, spatial gravity has less strength to pull us down than the earth. Similarly, Time gravity on the moon has less power to keep us from moving forward in Time and so our Time speeds up relative to Earth. Dark matter and dark energy might be the gravity from the 4D structures of objects and appear to us as adding spatial gravity when in fact they are just moving slow in time relative to us and so need less spatial gravity to stay in tact. When things get supermassive like blackholes Time gravity becomes more apparent and our sense of dark energy and dark matter is obscured. Because we don’t notice time slowing down for us means like the rock we don’t have a 4D consciousness to notice the impact on our 4D body on the moon relative to that on earth. We would require a consciousness of our 4D body to notice and form a memory of the resistance we have on earth to then compare to that on the moon. All we are aware of is the directional movement caused by Time gravity but not the strength of it. The only way to notice it would be to create a more complex contrast that doesn’t compare you to yourself but rather you to others. So staying near a blackhole for a day and then going back to earth and seeing that your children are now older than you. Quantum Gravity must also force an orientation of reality that causes a resistance in us. Our consciousness seems to collapse multiple universes together so maybe this isn’t a perception either but rather an impact of quantum gravity that we interpret as cohesion despite the presence of multiple universes making up our single experience. Multiverse gravity may force our consciousness to orient or interpret reality toward the singular and away from multiplicity. If this gravity were to lessen we would start to see multiplicity in reality depending on the scale that we are looking at. So essentially if there were no multiverse gravity we would see all the layers of multiverses. In other words, multiverse gravity maintains that our reference frame of reality stays singular so that we can have one consciousness. If there was no multiverse gravity then we would essentially experience all reference frames simultaneously and that would require a very complicated brain to build a consciousness into. So multiverse gravity is essential for creating an environment simplified enough for a brain to house a single reference frame, a single consciousness. But when we peer into quantum reality, multiverse gravity decreases and therefore is less powerful in forcing a single sense of reality. But if we were to ever shrink our body to the quantum level (like antman) our consciousness would literally float away. Multiverse gravity is what keeps our consciousness grounded to reality just like spatial gravity keeps us grounded to earth. Just like earth has a high escape velocity to escape the pull of its gravity, so to does the object sitting in the multiversal space that holds our consciousness together. The multiversal space has objects in it with multiversal gravity, and these objects sitting in this space might be the true entity of our consciousness. Imagine little balls of consciousness existing side by side and connected by the multiversal gravity we impose such that those with more consciousness like humans are larger and ants are smaller and people in our past are out of our knowable multiversal universe in one direction and those in the future are out of our universe in the opposite direction but those near us in Time and Space and Emotion we experience them here on earth. Like Taco is small but her planet is close to mine and that translated into Kira adopting her and that’s why I can feel her consciousness so strongly and perhaps she’s closer to me than to Kira in that space but not in physical or emotional space, just consciousness space; I’m aware of her consciousness very strongly so she must be close. Just like how Time was thought to be a perception as opposed to a force acting on us, consciousness and separately emotion are thought to be perceptions contained in the brain rather than forces acting on a higher dimensional existence. Imagine if we were just a brain with no body and therefore no senses with which to experience 3D space. We would still be impacted by spatial gravity and though we would not understand the concept of being rolled down a hill, the impact on how the brain’s neurons fire would be impacted by its rolling and so the thoughts being created in the brain would change based on whether it’s being rolled vs spun vs nothing, and so the brain would think that what it is experiencing is a perception it is creating, it thinks it is choosing what to think but in truth what it is thinking is being impacted or forced into an orientation of reality based on if it is being rolled or spun; and it would further not be able to imagine that there is a 3D space dimension containing a 3D object called earth that imparts a gravitational force that change the way being rolled or thrown impact the brain (being thrown is the same as speed is to spatial gravity and so it has the same effect), and that its thoughts are housed in a 3D structure called the brain but that it can’t know this because it doesn’t have eyes to create contrasts to reveal it. So we might be 3D thought inside a higher dimensional brain being rolled down a 4D hill that our 3D thought calls time. We might actually all be inside a massive higher dimensional or infinite dimensional brain of which we to it just thought. Anyway, the point is, we experience the effect of spatial gravity but we can also see it and so we can rest assured space exists and objects in it create spatial gravity. But the seeing of it, while it proves the existence of 3D space from our perspective, us seeing it is not necessary for it to exist. The fact that we are impacted by spatial gravity is evidence enough that 3D space exists even though its not enough to prove it. Like, it’s enough that planes fly for us to get on one but we don’t have to actually prove how it works for it to fly. So generalizing that to other things we experience, we experience a forced movement in what we interpret as Time so there must be a Time Space in which a Time object is driving that force that orients our interpretation and experience. We experience consciousness separate from other consciousnesses that stays singular and intact which is the result of a force holding together our reference frame of reality and so there is a Multiverse Space with a multiverse object imposing multiverse gravity that impacts our existence and forces our consciousness onto the surface of the brain so that we can’t jump into someone else’s brain or reference frame. Then there is an emotional experience with the impact of chemicals that we interpret as emotions so there is an emotional space with an emotional object that imposes emotional gravity that holds together our chemical truth, our subconscious truth, our true self. So there is Spatial, Time, Multiversal, Emotional/Chemical/True-Self.     \\n',\n",
       " 'Emotional reality: Narcissits have a flattened dimension relative to all other’s emotional presence in the sense that another person from the perspective of the narcissist’s reality has no room to move around the narcissist without causing the narcissist to see a paradox of the other person either teleporting, stepping out of reality, or passing through them like a ghost. The person can’t step around or squeeze past a narcissist. To keep their reality cohesive, the narcissist would force an observation of the other person bumping into them and this of course triggers anger “There’s no room for you to go out with your friends because that means you are telling me I’m not good enough for your friends (bumping into) and that’s impossible because I’m better than everyone.” But the other person sees reality in their own reference frame and so they saw themselves walk around the narcissist so they’re like “no, I actually walked around you, ie I am not rejecting you but my friends want to open up about their problems and they won’t feel comfortable if you’re there” and to the narcissist this paints the image of the other person saying they teleported or can walk through solid matter. So the narcissist trys to force the other person into replacing their reference frame of emotional reality with the narcissists so that the other person walks according to the space provided in the narcissists reality so that the other person knows when the narcissist is going to be bumped into and therefore avoids doing the things they want in their life to avoid the narcissist feeling bumped into. Self abandonment, the definition of, is the abandonment of ones emotional reference frame for another’s; or living in someone else’s emotional reference frame ie interpretations of emotional reality. Borderline is separate from narcissism in that there is space for people to squeeze by but it causes fear in the borderline when people get close because while they know that there is room for people to move around them they also know that people getting closer creates a higher likelihood of a paradox occurring. A borderliner gets scared when someone is nearing the edge of their emotional reality and therefore is close to creating a paradox and triggering wounding. The borderliner closed off parts of reality due to abuse and doesn’t want to accept that those areas of reality are actually still there so when someone gets close to creating a paradox and exposing reality the borderliner freaks out. So emotional healing is the stretching out of one’s reality to create more emotional depth and space for others to move around in their reality without creating a paradox in one’s own reference frame. True emotional healing is when you can allow anyone to walk around in your emotional reality that has good intent such that they do not ever create a paradox.  Someone with bad intent is going to try to create paradoxes in your emotional reality and try to convince you that that is true reality and you should expand your reference frame so that they can travel into that part of reality in your reference frame without triggering you. It’s like trying to convince your girlfriend that you cheating on her didn’t mean anything and they should just allow it. The boyfriend has a part of reality in his reference frame that is not shared by the girlfriend and so the boyfriend tries to get her to include it which is self abandonment. The boundaries of one’s emotional reference frame are what we call boundaries. Offensive boundaries are when we avoid walking into parts of our own reality that would create paradoxes in someone else’s reference frame. Defensive boundaries are when we refuse to let people that we have invited into our reference frame from creating a paradox in it. Borderliners are too boundaried and need to expand. People pleasers take on the reference frame of others. Narcissists impose their reference frame on others and don’t care about creating paradoxes in other people’s reference frames. Borderliners do not want to create paradoxes in other people’s reference frame unless it is to protect a paradox from being created in theirs. Narcissists are different from borderliners in that they will happily create paradoxes in other people’s reference frames regardless of whether or not they were at risk of a paradox being created by someone else and like borderliners they will also create a paradox in someone else’s reference frame to prevent one from being created in theirs. People pleasers adopt someone else’s reference frame as their own. Most humans have two slots for reference frames: an Ego slot which is one’s own emotional reference frame and is synonymous with self directed empathy, and what is commonly referred to as Empathy so an Empathy slot which holds a copy of someone else’s emotional reference frame which is the result of outward directed empathy. The more emotional intelligence the more detailed either slot can be. Sociopaths, however, have no slots. Narcissists only have the ego slot. Borderliners have both. Dopapaths have both but put way more of their attention (dopamine) on their Ego slot unless someone is forcing them to do otherwise. People pleasers have both but they mislabel them and so someone else’s Ego slot/reference frame they use as their own Ego reference frame and then become dopapathic on top of that in the sense that they pay attention to what they labeled as their Ego slot instead of what they labeled as their empathy slot so they may appear like empathetic people but they are in major self abandonment. Such a person will seek out friends and a community in order to feel alive because building what they call their Ego slot (building their ego and feeling their ego) requires a connection to other people’s Ego slots so they are going to feel completely empty and alone without being connected to others (inverse narcissism). These people might be good at raising narcissists. Dopapaths can present as sociopathic because they will act like they are building a copy of your reference frame in their empathy slot but they feigning it because it doesn’t give them dopamine to do it but if you get mad at them or threaten to leave they will snap out of the sociopathy. Sociopaths neither have an Ego or Empathy slot and so they feign both an Ego one or an Empathy one in order to get what they want or need from someone. A borderliner has both but their Ego reference frame may overlap with their physical reference frame too much where they over interpret physical things to be more emotional than they are and so the physical behavior of another that isn’t actually emotional pops up in the borderliners emotional reality as a location in emotional reality and where it ends up is variable and unstable because it isn’t real and so it’s more likely to create paradoxes and anger the borderliner. A schizophrenic seems to have both but their empathy reference frame overlaps too much with their physical reference frame and so they become paranoid because they interpret an emotional reference frame of their physical environment and then see their own emotional body within that reference frame. A borderliner has their own Ego reference frame prior to experiencing a physical environment that they project into that reference frame. But a schizophrenic creates an emotional reference frame for their physical environments, not for themself, and then forgets they created it and then projects themself into that emotional reference frame thinking its real because they forget they created it. Contrasting this with a people please, a people please does not project themself into someone else’s reference frame, they internalize someone’s reference frame as their own. A schizophrenic feels like their emotional reference frame has been internalized by a perceived external emotional reference frame in their external physical environment of their own making, but they forget it’s of their own making and this creates a sense of needing to escape reality to save one’s self. It’s almost like they are trying to eject their ego, runaway in the most extreme way possible from their pain or perceived pain by ejecting the Ego slot but making it seem like it’s trying to be taken. It’s almost like their brain is trying to eject their ego slot but the conscious mind is unaware of this and so it interprets reality as if someone is trying to take away their ego slot. When people are dating, the goal is to build a shared cohesive reality in which no self abandonment is occurring and the full reality even if it is missing some parts for someone (like non-monogamy) is fully embraced. It take truth and communication (NOT trust) to build this. Trust does not allow both to live in the same shared reality but merely to hope they are. Truth and communication and consistency and getting to know each other’s reference frame builds a knowledge and vision of existing in a shared reality. Truth and communication allow someone to explore the ins and outs of your own reference frame so that when you build a shared one both people are able to actually see the additions being made rather than hoping that they are being made. Example, Meghan doesn’t trust that I won’t cheat on her, she knows it because I have communicated and demonstrated the cohesion in my emotional reality such that cheating on her or deceiving her would create a paradox in my own reality and therefore would not be the real me. A Narcissits will use someone’s trust but will never try to demonstrate the cohesion in their reality. But eventually a person will see the lack of cohesion between what they say and what they do and will realize they never knew them. It is impossible to lie your way to cohesion, eventually cracks will show. If you tell the truth then you are demonstrating cohesion by also demonstrating where your reality boundaries are which is vulnerable. In other words, you are revealing that your cohesion stops here and that you haven’t matured to the point to expand your reality further in this area (this is communication of both your empathy and your lack of empathy). If you don’t communicate your bounds then your partner may rely on Trust that you have cohesion in an area that you don’t. A narcissists would therefore say “My boundaries are everywhere and I want to take from you and cheat on you. I have no empathy or emotional depth or room for you in my reality”. A normal person might say “Sometimes I might get jealous but I know it’s wrong and please boundary me so that I can learn how to expand that part of my emotional reality so that I can allow you to walk in there” (a boundary of emotional reality where a paradox is created by their partner when say an attractive person talks to them). You have to build your dynamic externally to yourselves. You don’t just add all of your reference frame to the dynamic and allow them to walk wherever they want. By spending quality time together you are slowly adding parts of your emotional reality to the dynamic for them to get to know and walk around in. Over time you will have added your entire emotional reference frames together. Growing together in a dynamic is when you communicate new expansions in your reality and talk to them about adding them to the dynamic or not which would require the other person to expand their own. Growing separate is doing growth on your own but hiding it from the dynamic and therefore not allowing your partner to grow that area as well, or using the dynamic as a roadmap to grow yourself emotionally but acting like you are adding real parts of yourself but really you want to be with a more mature person to help you become more mature.        \\n',\n",
       " 'The way in which we build a shared emotional reality is by starting with our Ego slot and going in the world and accepting reflections back of us from other people in the context of their emotional reference frame. Knowing how our emotional reference frame is interpreted by someone else gives us blueprints of their emotional reality and missing or fake components of our emotional reality, the latter of which comes after the former has been built and we can then compare the Ego slot and Empathy slot across multiple experiences to resolve paradoxes we see from the perspective of our Ego slot but updating and upgrading our emotional reference frame in a way that resolves the paradoxes we have with the reference frames in our Empathy slot which all may be unique or all be slightly different angles of the same part of reality that we are missing or misconstructed. This is what empathy is: the act of building and expanding upon our Ego reference frame a cohesive, simultaneously shared reality with others such that it would appear that we only have one slot, neither Ego nor Empathy, in the sense that we no longer have to do the work of learning anyone’s reference frames because we have built one that is cohesive for our Ego simultaneously with everyone else’s Ego reference frames. But everyone else has to be doing the same thing. If all humans were to successfully do this, then the emotional universe would come into existence and be clearly visible to us because we would no longer be the one’s creating it; it would exist on its own and be completely undeniable just like 3D physical reality is undeniable in the sense that we all see the sky as blue, and call down-down, and think a cat’s fur is soft, etc. The building of a global emotional reference frame is only possible because each humans is experiencing a unique impact of emotional space or gravity that tells them who they are and the depth around them that they can then communicate to others to build a map of emotional space. It’s kind of like being in a room of 20 people and randomly placed in some random shaped room with objects and blindfolded and you are not allowed to walk around but you are allowed to feel around and speak and you have to work together to build an image of the shape of the room, the objects in it, where you are in relation to the room and where you are in relation to everyone else. When you have all developed the full language that illuminates all of these things and become fluent in it to be second nature then you no longer have to create the image of it and now you would be able to walk around the room without bumping into anyone or any object and would be able to walk around collectively. For example, imagine you all wanted to reorient your position in the room because one person needed water, another wanted to sit on the couch, another go to the bathroom, etc. Then you could all work together in that language and solve the solution of how to reorient yourselves quickly without ever taking off the blindfold because despite not being able to see the room, the language creates the visuals. Similarly, once we become fluent in the language the defines the single emotional reference frame that encompasses all reference frames in the world (including animals, ie all brains) that is cohesive to all brain’s ego reference frames then that will be internalized to the unconscious and no one will have any conscious need to be empathetic or be egotistical or have those slots (our conscious brain will eject them kind of like schizophrenia) because we will just naturally walk in this cohesive space together without bumping into anyone. This is how spoken language works. When we are learning a new spoken language we need to have both speech ego and speech empathy. Speech ego is someone who is trying to grow their fluency and vocabulary and style. Speech empathy is trying to understand how fluent, heard, and understood you speech is to someone listening to you. If you used a word someone didn’t understand they would ask “what does that mean?” and they would accept the reflection back and increase their vocabulary. But maybe instead, you miss pronounced a word and the person corrects you and now you have increased your fluency. Or someone says you can say that more beautifully this way or that was beautifully said and you can increase your style or they can increase theirs. But once an entire population of people is fluent the need for the awareness of speech ego and speech empathy is no longer needed: this is what fluency is, a lack of need for conscious awareness of both ego and empathy. And so when you speak you know you are saying everything exactly as you want AND the exact thing you are choosing to say is automatically tailored to the person listening such that you know 100% that they understand you. Fluency allows people to speak a language to each other without creating misunderstandings, or paradoxes (difference in what was understood vs what the person speaking expected to be understood), no one has to learn anything, and this all happens naturally without any conscious thought. And language is reality so when we speak empathy fluently that is the equivalent of a single language spoken fluently by everyone (ie cohesive) in full consent without any misunderstandings or paradoxes or difference of opinions on what was said or understood and no learning is required and this is all done without awareness so that no one questions it or thinks they can convince people that red means blue etc so they have to accept that red means red. So no one will be egotistical or a people please. Sociopaths will be like someone who is mute. Psychopaths will be visible to us as someone who speaks gibberish. Borderliners will be obvious as people who speak too loud or too soft. Bipolar will be people who speak too fast or too slow. Schizophrenics will be speaking to themselves. But language builds reality and the fact that we can build is proof that it already exists and we are just translating its impact on us into the world to translate it into a language that our physical brain can comprehend. So Emotional reality is really a space dimension of reality that exists regardless of life but that impacts our brains in such a way that we interpret them as emotions.  \\n',\n",
       " 'The example that shows perception vs interpretation is physical reality. We are not perceiving 3D space and the objects within it. But they impact our brain through our senses in such unique ways that we are able to develop a rich language in which to describe reality. In other words, we interpret the effects of reality from objects that are real regardless of our perception of it through language and then we make it cohesive in the population through the process of Ego and Empathy (awareness of self in relation to others, and awareness of others in relation to self). Culture is an example of this with empathy but the roots of culture are not in empathy and are arbitrary. If we do this with empathy fully, then we will naturally teach our kids empathy and traumatizing kids will be a thing of the past because that would be like speaking gibberish to them, although there could be neglect due to a parents lack of intelligence in speaking language. Our brains did not produce an illusion of emotional reality just like we didn’t for time, proven by Einstein, we merely interpret its impact with language that is cohesive to all of us. This implies that even if eyes are capable of seeing color, if the brain behind the eyes is incapable of language to describe the color then the animal does not actually see color. And further, if we are able to develop language for something then there is an object that is part of real reality that is having an impact on us evidenced by our interpretation of it. Schizophrenia is the act of interpreting something that isn’t there and why scizohrenia is visible to us is because it can’t be made cohesive. The only interpretations or language that can be made cohesive in a population are those created from impacts by objects that are cohesive to reality. If we were creating the object in our head and then interpreting it then we would not be able to make our language cohesive to other people. Now you might say that the object is the brain and it creates the illusion of the same perception so that we all agree that murder is wrong as if that’s encoded in our DNA. But maybe what is encoded in our DNA is more sensitivity to the impact of objects in our reality such that we are able to interpret the impact of an emotional object as “this is murder and it’s wrong” whereas other animals are getting impacted by the same object but they are unable to create the language to fully describe its impact. This also proves the force behind evolution having a theme or direction in regards to emotion. Evolution can only operate from real reality, not perceived from the brain in terms of changing our DNA. So the fact that our DNA evolution is directed toward being more sensitive to emotions and language just like we clearly sees it’s driven to be more sensitive to the physical environment via language, suggests that there is an emotional reality against which evolution is given direction to ensure our survival in that emotional space. If emotional space weren’t really there then we wouldn’t see a clear directional path that evolution is taking us toward. It would be arbitrary and not universal and growing with time. It wouldn’t be stable. It would change on a dime. Humans would have much more variety in the sense that half would believe murder is wrong and half would not understand the concept of murder. Our brains are made cohesive against some backdrop of a cohesive object experienced indirectly through its impact on us that evolution uses to guide our development of both the granularity and sensitivity of the impact and the granularity and sensitivity of our brains ability to describe it with language. Evolution is the name we give to Life gravity. The human body is the physically spoken language that makes humans cohesive. This language is stored in and created with DNA. Human DNA is the language that describes humans’ cohesive interpretation of physical reality created by evolution against the contrast of physical reality for the purpose of creating objects in the direction of ever increasing the sensitivity to its impacts; and the human body is that language spoken into physical reality. It stands to reason then that all consciousnesses are the storage of emotional language that describes our cohesive interpretation of emotional reality created by evolution against the contrast of emotional reality for the purpose of creating objects in the direction of ever increasing sensitivity to its impacts: ie consciousnesses are the equivalent of expressed emotional DNA via chemical truth but they are so rudimentary that the emotional body/the consciousness does not have an emotional consciousness of its own in the sense that we are not aware of our existence in emotional space just like a brain without a body would be unaware of its presence in physical reality. We have an emotional body but if we have an emotional consciousness then we are unable to use that body to create a reflection of ourself in emotional reality to confirm our existence or we are not emotionally intelligent enough to notice our reflection just like an ant. An ant isn’t conscious, at least in 3D cohesive space because it can’t cast a 3D reflection and notice itself as being 3D, but it does cast a 3D reflection. Similarly, we are casting a reflection in emotional reality but are unable to notice that we are and so we see 0 dimensions of emotional reality. We might be the ants of emotional reality. At any rate, if this is true then eventually evolution will build an emotional body and brain that is capable of both casting and noticing a reflection made in emotional reality and further advance the cohesive language of empathy through the building of more complex bodies capable of creating deeper contrasts/reflections and richer emotional conscious language against emotional reality. \\n',\n",

       " 'Reality may be such that a higher dimensional brain is growing and just like any growth process, a brain must grow in stages. Neuroscientists probably think that our physical brain just comes into consciousness all of a sudden because we clearly do not have consciousness when we are babies so when do we? So it could be that consciousness grows continuously through higher dimensions and enters one through conception and exits through death. A brain can only contain one consciousness at a time and so when the brain’s development reaches the 4th dimension it has to get rid of the 3D consciousness which is interpreted in our reality as loss of awareness of 3D cohesive reality ie 3D death and gain of awareness of 4D cohesive reality, ie birth of consciousness into a 4D body. Since all of reality is cohesive this means that life forms that do not exhibit 3D cohesive consciousness which is self awareness in 3D space in the sense that you have awareness of when you change your 3D orientation in reality (note that humans are not 4D cohesive conscious as proven by the fact if we are on the moon time has slowed down for us but we are unable to notice that time has slowed down because we can’t recognize the effect that Time is having on our body relative to Earth—we lose awareness of our previous 4D orientation). An ant might be 1D cohesive meaning they believe they live in a 1D spatial universe such that when they change direction they are unaware of their previous orientation of reality so they always think that they are going straight just like we always think we are moving forward in time at the same rate regardless of the gravity we are under. So the reality that the ant is observing is in the same cohesive space as us BUT their perception of it is 1D spatial. They are unaware that they have a body and existence that extends into 2D and 3D and are affected by Time. In their reality there is no such thing as 2D and 3D, and 2D (switching of orientation feels like time to them perhaps). They have created in their head a 1D language or explanation of reality but since reality is fully cohesive we can view their 3D body since we are 3D conscious beings. But we can’t view their 2D body since we do not perceive reality as 2D cohesive. So though from our reference frame ants live in 3D cohesive space, from their reference frame they have a 1D body and live in 1D cohesive space and interpret the effects of eating 3D food as sustenance in 1D space in a way that makes sense to them. Their 3D brain gets nutrition and that translates into their 1D reference frame. So the way in which reality stays cohesive in the sense that all N-dimensional, for all N, objects coexist In the same cohesive reality is through re-interpretation via N-dimensional reference frames for all N. We can’t see 2D beings because we have a 3D reference frame. And we can’t see our 4D bodies because we have a 3D reference frame. For example, no one in 4D knows or can read that I am writing this. It would be just as hard for them to come up with the knowledge as it is for me. They are not necessarily smarter than we are either just because they are 4D beings or more powerful. Their reference frames force them to be equally as intelligent as 3D reference frames. And they don’t have power over us because they actually view or manipulate their 4D cohesive environment in 3D cross sections and so they can’t control our perception of reality in a way that would appear to us as intelligent or having a purpose. But that doesn’t mean we aren’t affected by what happens in 4D; it just means they make decisions in 4D based on the effects they observe in 4D; they can’t view the effects they have in 3D and so they can’t say change the laws of physics or cure cancer or make me jump up and down because they can’t see their effects. But in order for reality to stay fully cohesive the effects in 4D need to impact 3D and then it’s up to our brain or physical bodies to interpret those impacts in such a way to create an impact or movement in our 3D world. The building of reality cohesion of life forms is complicated but reality cohesion can’t be violated so that gives the structure evolution needs to build life forms whose behavior affects lower dimensional beings cohesively. In other words, the way we interpret higher dimensional impact within our lower dimensional reference frame has been perfectly curated to not violate reality cohesion because if we did we would create a paradox and cease to exist. We can’t break cohesion any more than we can teleport. The reason why we can’t Time travel is because we have no conscious control or awareness of our 4D body or environment such that we can instruct it to make a movement that our brain would interpret as moving backward in time. Our 4D body is probably not capable of making a movement that would push us backward in time in the sense that would be equivalent to it teleporting in its environment. This suggests that there is no free will. From our 3D conscious reference frame, we are unaware of the impact 4D is having on us so we can’t tell if our 4D body is reacting instinctively to the impact of its 4D environment that is being translated into our 3D reference frame into the appearance of choice in our 3D environment, or if we are the ones actually making the choice and there is no 4D impact. It’s possible there is some free-will but more the most part and for the big things there isn’t. Like me writing all this down might not be free-will because it does feel like I’m reading it from a book as if being translated into my 3D brain. Maybe when the 4D brains are dreaming we are able to have free-will in 3D. Without knowing how many dimensions of reality there are we can never be sure if there is perfect free-will or not. It might also be the case that from our reference frame, before we are about to die we drop out of 3D awareness and into 4D awareness so that we don’t experience it but others experience us experiencing it in order to maintain cohesion. This means that we are operating in 4D based purely on instinct from the perspective of our 3D reference frame and because we lack consciousness in 4D since a brain can only experience one consciousness at a time. The body and brain has to be built in 4D before a consciousness can occupy it and so we exist in 1D, 2D, 3D until such time that it is ready for us to enter. Ants being 1D cohesive might be the form that a brain takes in our 3D reference frame when it is only at the stage of 1D consciousness, and 2D is another animal and 3D another and human is one of the last stages because we are nearly 4D conscious. So maybe our brains have grown continuously through 3D consciousness in the sense that we have been an ant, and a cow, and a bird, and a dolphin until we reach human that is nearly 4D conscious and when we die as a human we enter the first stage of 4D consciousness in 4D reality as if to be a 4D ant.  \\n',\n",

       " 'Reality is fully cohesive in all its dimensions, and cohesive implies spatial so if there are 10 cohesive dimensions of reality then they must all be spatial regardless of how our brain interprets them. If our brain can’t interpret all as cohesive space or can’t even interpret some of them then it’s our brain that is wrong. If reality has more than 3 cohesive dimensions which is likely given that we experience time and Einstein showed the time and space connection then at the very least Evolution just hasn’t yet figured out how to create a higher dimensional consciousness capable of COHESIVELY interpreting more than 3 dimensions. Reality may also contain 0, 1 and 2 dimensional cohesion consciousnesses such that their spatial reality is 0, 1, or 2 dimensions. Their higher dimensional body matter that houses their lower dimensional consciousness  would still be affected by the higher dimensions creating higher dimensional signals and reactions of that body matter that the vessel containing their lower dimensional consciousness experiences in the higher dimensions but interprets it in the lower dimensional reference frame. When the signal is interpreted the consciousness comes alive, is aware it’s alive in its lower dimensional view of cohesive reality but it is unaware of the original dimensionality of the signal and believes that fills reality is what it experiences. In particular our 4D body matter is receiving signals from existing in 4D cohesive space but our 3D cohesive consciousness is generated from a 3D cohesive reference frame and so the reference frame converts the 4D signal into a 3D signal + observation signal. The 3D signal is what we call 3D cohesive space and is our base consciousness which is the ability to notice one’s self in 3D space. Then there is an extra dimension to consciousness which is the ability to notice one’s self noticing one’s self—awareness of consciousness or what I call awareness of life or self. So our full consciousness is awareness of self in reality and awareness of reality in self. In other words we are able to project our reference frame (our consciousness) out of our body and so be aware of ourself in an external environment AND we are aware that we are doing this which is somehow as if we are internalizing reality into our own reference frame in the sense that we can view ourselves as if we are reality, we can view our own reference frame. This is perhaps the avenue that evolution uses to produce empathy: awareness of others in relation to self (self-awareness or Ego), and awareness of self as if another person’s reality ie awareness of another’s ego or awareness of how others see you in relation to themselves. More fundamental is the absence of others in the sense we are able to see ourself in relation to reality and are able to see how reality sees us in relation to itself. This is physical empathy because we are adopting some other physical reference frame that is not our own. Emotional empathy is when we see ourself from an emotional reference frame that is not our own. So empathy in general is seeing one’s self from a reference frame that is not your own while holding awareness that it is not your own, ie remembering one’s ego or reference frame while adopting another. It’s not empathy if you forget your own ego/reality which is why empaths and people pleasers are not empathetic. The Ego process allows 3D cohesion—it defines the skin of our consciousness. And the Empathy process is like the clothes we wear and can take off. So when that 4D reality signal is converted into the most accurate 3D representation reality that our consciousness can experience, this becomes the skin of our reality, our consciousness, our Ego, our cohesive reality, our spatial reality. The left over signal gets converted into the clothes we wear so they accent how we perceive ourselves from the perspective of reality (physical empathy) but they don’t add real spatial, cohesive dimensions to how we perceive ourself in reality. This is sort of like the error term or the residuals in regression where it’s an extra dimensional term to describe reality but it doesn’t add structure that we know how to interpret cause if it did we would add it to the regression to create a true extra dimension. The fitted value of the regression is equivalent to Ego. The error term is Empathy. Most animals are probably only aware of the prediction regression function but not the residuals or the concept of error; but humans are aware of both the prediction function, the predicted value which is awareness of self in 3D cohesive reality AND the residuals which is the parts of our interpreted (predicted reality) that don’t quite fit into how we perceive spatial cohesiveness ie Time, Emotion, Quantum, Multiverse. At least some of these structures are real but are absorbed in the error term. If the dependent variable is full reality then the predicted value is wrong and the residuals make the predictive function equal to the dependent variable: it makes the math work out, it makes reality as logical as it can. Essentially a prediction function in statistics is the most logical cohesive representation of high dimensional data in lower dimensional space and the residuals don’t add cohesion ie predictable structure across the output of the prediction function which is why residuals don’t create cohesion, but for each predicted value they can be shored up to make reality fully logical if not cohesive. We are impacted by full cohesive reality but we can only observe a subset of that cohesion and so our intelligence is driven to make the most sense out of our reality and so we are capable of creating interpretations of reality beyond our observe spatial cohesion that don’t add to our awareness of cohesion (don’t add an extra dimension of cohesion) but shore up our cohesive reality to our full experience of full reality. So we invented the concept of Time BUT note that our concept of time is not cohesive across all consciousnesses, across all reference frames and so Time does not look to us like a part of cohesive spatial reality because our observation of Time’s effects is subject to the reference frame that is observing it: relativity. In other words, each person is a 3D predicted value of reality and this defines their reference frame at experience of reality and so  they have a unique residual that shores up their reference frame ie awareness of reality to full reality: ie humans see themself aging or growing, and in addition their body ages at slower or faster rates depending on gravity and speed relative to others. But, humans do not notice that they are aging slower on the moon than on earth and this is because our Empathy process to see ourselves in relation to other reference frames is limited by our lack of perceptive depth and the finiteness of information travel ie the speed of light. People that we can perceive are in nearly the same exact reference frame as we are relative to the relativity effects that are happening around us. But if our consciousness was capable of interpreting the 4D signal as 4D then we would see the dimension that we experience as time from our 3D reference frame as being a spatial dimension cohesive with 3D; we would see reality as 4D spatial cohesion. And this is because the statistician that is modeling reality (evolution) would have found structure in the residuals that applies cohesively to all consciousnesses in reality as if to add an explanatory variable to the regression function; and what is cohesive is the estimated parameter of the new explanatory variable that makes our experience of reality cohesive and if something is cohesive then it is necessarily observed as spatial and so we would observe Time as a spatial dimension of reality. But currently, we believe there is this explanatory variable called time but the problem is the parameter value that veer explains someone’s perception of reality is not universal to all consciousnesses, ie it’s not universal to all reference frames. Each person has a parameter value that best explains their experience of Time that is DIFFERENT than the parameter value that would be estimated FOR THEM by someone else and this is because they are estimating/interpreting from a different reference frame than the one they are observing. So experiences of Time are NOT cohesive across all reference frames and so Time can’t be viewed as spatial. For instance if I am standing in the corner of a room and you are in the middle of the room, you will observe me in 3D space in the same exact location that I observe myself and so our experiences are cohesive. Now suppose I am far enough away such that I am being exposed to high gravity but you are not, then you will observe me moving slower in time but I will observe myself moving at exactly the same pace as I always have and you will look like you’re the one going faster in time. These experiences are not cohesive, we have different residuals that explain our experience of reality in relation to time. Evolution needs to figure out how to create a 4D reference frame such that in that same scenario it creates an experience for each observer that are equal in both 3D and Time; and the moment they become equal, structure will have been found in the residuals such that the parameter that best fits everyone’s experience of themselves in reality in relation to Time will be exactly the same and then suddenly a Space dimension gets added to 3D that is cohesive in our experience of reality, ie reality becomes 4D spatially cohesive. Cohesion is part of statistics: A regression function takes a higher dimensional reality that it can’t fully explain and turns it into a cohesive, connected, sometimes smooth, lower dimensional object. Cohesion is the requirement that you can travel from any point to any other point but must go though every point in between. So beyond our observable universe, that is not cohesive because we can’t get there. The fact that quantum particles can tunnel and break 3D cohesion or pass information instantaneously or exist in multiple places at one or pass through solid matter implies that there is more dimensions of spatial cohesion than just 3 and so they appear to us to defy 3D cohesion or our incorrect concept of Time but it’s only because we have an incorrect concept of time ie a reference frame that isn’t cohesive with 4D time that creates the illusion of quantum phenomena. So regression of full reality turns a 0 dimensional cohesive reference frame into a constant, a point which is trivially cohesive. A 1 dimensional cohesive reference frame is a line. A 2 dimensional cohesive reference frame is a plane. A 3 dimensional cohesive reference frame is 3D plane or cube, so on and so forth. But the residuals exist uniquely for each point of the surface of the cohesive object and so the resulting object when you add the residuals is the original high dimensional reality that we can’t make sense out of, and these unique residuals is what defines our consciousness because it determines our unique reference frame compared to the cohesive object of the prediction function. Evolution explains reality into a cohesive object using brains and the left over part that isn’t explained is what defines, creates, allows consciousness. So life and consciousness of life didn’t just happen by luck, we are necessary to maintain the cohesiveness of reality. If we didn’t exist consciously then reality would cease to be cohesive, completely unstructured, because it would just be noise. Evolution is the process through which a cohesive structure is created from the noise of reality such that consciousnesses are the bi-product of to keep reality in existence. Consciousness is the left over noise from reality against the backdrop of a cohesive structure of reality. Consciousness is the language created from the contrast between the fullness of reality and the cohesive structure that our brains separate from its consciousness uses to create our perception of reality. Each human brain (not including its consciousness) is a predicted cube added to the surface of human’s shared reality (like an added dot to a line). Each human extends the bounds of cohesion of our shared reality so it’s finite but unbounded: this is the true self. But the consciousness of each brain that is an added cube to the fitted regression function is the residuals that maintain the brains presence as being part of reality which isn’t luck, it’s automatic. If our brain did not have consciousness ie residuals didn’t exist, then it would be imaginary, not part of reality, because it would be a projection into a lower dimensional reality and therefore not connected to the full reality. Residuals connect the fitted values back to the full dimension of the reality they are trying to explain, so likewise our consciousness connects our brains from its existence in a lower dimensional reality to the full reality. Without consciousness the brain could not exist within full reality. Consciousness isn’t an accident, it’s required for a brain to exist. So at least all things with a brain or an ability to structure a cohesive reality outside of itself evidenced by responding externally to reality, ostensibly what we call life, necessarily has a residual in order for it to exist at all and therefore has a degree of consciousness. The length of one’s residual determines one’s level of consciousness. Brains that are able to make the most cohesive sense out of reality possess a consciousness that is higher than others in other words it’s brain’s explanation of full reality is slightly less distanced from, closer to the fullness of reality—they have a smaller residual in absolute value. We have several residuals in multiple dimensions. For instance, the degree to which we make cohesive sense of reality in the directions of social or emotional or logical environment creates its own residual in our brain which defines the degree of awareness of that part of reality. So if your brain can create cohesive structure of emotional reality better than anyone else then this will produce an in-to-out, ie a residual, that has a higher emotional awareness such that will for instance no longer exhibit childhood trauma. The true healing of emotional trauma is the creation of added cohesive structure to one’s emotional reference frame that gets pushed out into the physical brain such that it reduces the emotional residual and elevates the consciousness to a new level that no longer is capable of exhibiting the trauma. This theory demonstrates how consciousness level is multidimensional and continuous across life and capable of growing through in-to-out processes. Some animals may be more conscious than humans in some aspects where it is naturally good at structuring (like hunting) or even more conscious emotionally than some humans like a smart cat versus a human with down syndrome. When we provide structure of reality to any newborn animal (caregiving or not) we are allowing it to mirror itself off that structure and allow its brain to build and mature its own structure of reality thereby creating its own unique residuals and therefore consciousness and what we call personality or sensibilities: the backdrop of reality off which to see itself. This is why consistency is important so that that backdrop is stable and accurate off which to see our reflection, our ego in the world. If the backdrop of the world is inaccurate cause of bad parenting like spoiling then the kid will become narcissistic seeing its ego as the best. An accurate backdrop of reality leads to a balanced and stable view of self since reality is actually stable. But the point is, the backdrop of reality is how we define our residuals and if it’s undulating aggressively then our residuals are in constant flux and therefore so is our consciousness and image of self. If it’s not accurate then we have a skewed sense of self either worthless or having more worth than is true. If it looks distant to us then the residuals are large and we are not defined with precision: it’s easier to estimate a foot away than it is to estimate a mile away so if you’re getting reflections back from reality but the backdrop is far away than you might not be able to pick up a signal at all and though it defines your consciousness just the same, you are not aware of that part of your consciousness. So all things exhibit emotional consciousness but those whose emotional signal reflected back from reality isn’t strong enough, lack emotional awareness, or if it’s slightly strong enough then they their estimate of how far they are from the backdrop of reality may have high variability and so they their awareness of that particular dimension of their consciousness might be over or under exaggerated in their belief system of self. This is why children say they want to be an astronaut when they grow up because they do not have a strong awareness of their consciousness to know that when they grow up they will want to be a musician. As children age, the backdrop of reality comes into focus in unique ways based on both nature and nurture and their unique combination of resulting residuals determines their sense of self, personality, as well as their decision making. If someone had to make a choice in any given moment, if I knew that person’s full set of residuals, I should be able to perfectly predict the choice they are going to make, so it’s likely that there isn’t free-will. Our consciousness, ie residuals, is always in flux. Consciousness is defined by the signal we get back from a reflection against our reference frame of reality, the exact length of the signal; and our measurement of where we are in reality, the estimated length of that signal, is our awareness of consciousness, our estimate of our consciousness. Awareness of consciousness is the effect of the signal defining our consciousness being strong enough for us to notice we are reflecting and therefore measure. Schizophrenia is having a brain that creates a structure of reality wildly incohesive with other brains and therefore the consciousness its residuals define appears to us as uncommon. Increasing one’s awareness is the ability to more accurately measure the strength of the signal of one’s self off of reality: like improving one’s eyesight. Increasing consciousness is the strengthening of the signal that one is getting which for a fixed brain also creates a bump in awareness since for a fixed brain it’s easier to more precisely and accurately measure a stronger signal. Objects in reality that are not conscious are not conscious because they have no residuals. They don’t have a thing inside of them that anchor them to a lower dimensional cohesive view of reality off which to create residuals. Brains just happen to be able to do that, and perhaps all of life in some way. So quantum reality does not have to obey a lower dimensional structure of reality as it is part of the noise of reality. Our brain however puts our lower dimensional structure onto it and so we observe paradoxical things that aren’t cohesive to us at fine scales. But the residuals/signals created from our structure coming off the backdrop of quantum reality are too weak for us to measure and so quantum phenomena are out of our awareness BUT quantum phenomenon IS part of what defines our consciousness because it is a reflection or residual of all reality versus our brain’s structure of reality. We therefore are only aware of signals from quantum reality that coalesce and appear to us to be a single signal like a particle but that are like strings wrapped together to create a rope. We see the rope and think it’s a single signal but it’s actually composed of several signals. So quantum phenomena can’t be viewed until its signal becomes strong enough for us to measure and by that time it starts following the laws of standard physics. If we were able to measure the signals of the wave directly then we would become aware of quantum reality in the sense we would understand it as being cohesive with our understanding of reality instead of just being conscious of its effects. This all means that if there was a brain that could perfectly explain all the structure of reality as a set of finite explanatory variables then there would be no residuals and therefore no consciousness or awareness of consciousness because this brain would be the equivalent of reality just oriented and expressed in the cohesive structure of the explanatory variables as opposed to just being high dimensional noise. Is this God? Who knows. Maybe evolution is on the path to structuring a God brain such that it exists in a cohesive spatial reality with no movement or time forever and creates no residuals. The shape of the universe by the way is biased by our reference frame. So it’s not the shape of the universe we should be wondering, it’s the shape of our fitted reality according to our regression function. When the regression function changes like adding another explanatory variable then so does the shape of the universe we perceive and so it doesn’t make sense to talk about the shape of the universe as an absolute thing: it’s respective to the brain or species asking. All of this also implies that any single dimension of reality can’t be infinite or else the residuals would be infinite and it wouldn’t define a consciousness because no signal could be received back from that dimension of reality that we reflect our structure of reality off of to define our consciousness. We would be blind from a conscious perspective of that dimension of reality forever. There probably can’t be an infinite number of dimensions of reality either since that would mean that our consciousness is also infinite BUT the validity of an infinite consciousness falls out directly from the validity of an infinite dimensional reality. In other words, if an infinite dimensional reality is valid (which humans can probably never answer yes or no to) then so must be an infinite dimensional consciousness since reality is what creates the residuals, not the brain. Making an infinite dimensional brain is impossible and not valid but an infinite consciousness is possible and valid and automatic if reality is infinite dimensional. What IS finite is the dimensionality of awareness since that is a process that our brain generates through measuring the signals back from full reality against its cohesive structure that becomes our awareness. The brain has to effectively and efficiently and consistently receive the signals and measure them for our awareness to be built. If it doesn’t do them quickly and effectively then our awareness will be fragmented relative to the happenings of reality around us and we will die and not have offspring: if we experienced time passing in one unit relative to all others experiencing 10 units then we would not see the lion that is about to eat us until we are being eaten. The speed of light puts a limit or constraint of the creation of awareness ie the receiving and measuring of signals. If light were infinitely fast then our awareness would be so fast our brain wouldn’t have the ability to keep up with all the processing of updated reality. Lightspeed being finite means that we are able to create segment reality into finite chunks to create the illusion of time: awareness of self in reality. This is why light has no concept of time. Of light speed were infinite then perhaps that would make awareness infinite dimensional and since awareness is a process of measuring infinite reality then awareness would never be able to be built because it would never finish in a finite amount of measurements. So the fact that light speed IS finite might imply that reality is infinite dimensional, in other words if reality wasn’t infinite dimensional then there would be no reason to make lightspeed finite. The fact that light speed being finite makes it possible for a finite awareness to exist in an infinite dimensional reality might be highly suggestive of reality being infinite dimensional. Awareness is finite dimensional even if consciousness isn’t because for a fixed brain, light speed being finite puts a non-zero minimum requirement on the strength of the signals across all the infinite signals it is receiving—that define its consciousness—that that brain is capable of processing to build its awareness of its consciousness. Since reality is infinite, for any given brain that cohesively explains only a finite number of dimensions of reality, only a finite number of the infinite signals surpass the threshold of strength necessary to trigger the brain to measure. So humans awareness seems to be 3D space, Time, and Emotions. This also means that if something is in our awareness then it necessarily is a dimension of reality since we can only be aware of it by reflections of self off of reality. So there is a dimension of reality that sends back a signal that we interpret in our awareness as emotions. There is also one that we interpret as Time. This process of measuring the signals might be what we experience as Time and be affected by gravity and velocity which creates the notion of relativity. Gravity has an effect on our cohesive  structure of reality affecting the awareness measurements of the signals coming back. Light determines the bounds of our 3D cohesive reference frame; and this prevents the paradox of having to create a reference frame that is infinitely cohesive ie a consciousness that understands infinity. A lower dimensional reference frame can’t be infinitely cohesive because then the regression function wouldn’t be calculable ie the predictive function that creates our consciousness would have to extend to infinity which would never complete the creation of a reference frame and therefore no consciousness would ever be created. It’s like drawing an infinite line but only when your pen leaves the page because you’re finished drawing the infinite line is a consciousness created but since it’s infinite you would never lift your pen off the paper. Gravity distorts information being sent out and received. Spatial gravity is what we call the distortions of signals received in the dimensions of our reality that our brain explains cohesively ie what is external to our consciousness, what we incorrectly call reality. Light is a cohesive particle in full reality, in other words, if we saw reality as 4D cohesive then light would travel is 4D space. So despite the fact that we are only able to see 3D cohesive light, there is light in all dimensions of reality. This might be why we describe quanta as existing in waves, because it is existing as a cohesive particle in all dimensions of reality but we can only observe a cross section of its cohesiveness but its true nature of existing in more dimensions means we have to experience it as a wave in order to have it make sense in our cohesion despite the paradox. In other words, the multidimensional effects of a particle that exists in all dimensions of reality is best translated as a wave in a lower dimensional cohesion. If it looked like a particle then it would only be in 3D cohesive reality and so wouldn’t really exist in full reality: it would be like how a cartoon doesn’t really exist. Maybe for infinite dimensional reality to exist, it can’t really be matter or even “real” but rather infinite noise or waves that exist everywhere that our brains create a meaningful structure out of that we all share. So maybe we are just being bombarded by noise of reality and we are just things that make sense out of noise that isn’t at all structured. So the natural state of reality is a wave and there is no substance to it. But brains create an illusion of substance and gravity structures waves to coalesce so that it isn’t unstructured noise. So particles aren’t real, they’re an illusion of our brain causes by its bias to interpret structure. Superposition is just the raw noise of reality prior to our brain interpreting its effects on our 3D cohesive interpretation of reality. As soon as we interpret it, we do so in our reference frame which aligns the structure of quantum waves put on them by gravity to our 3D cohesive reference frame. So gravity is a full dimensional force that brings structure to quantum waves, three dimensions of which our brains perceive as reality and interpret it as solid. Without gravity, reality would just be noise. The brain itself is structured wave used to interpret structured waves. Note, that a brain that takes M dimensional cohesive slices of structured noise cannot see reality in any other dimension of reality. So we cannot see the world as 2D cohesive and 4D cohesive. So it’s possible for their to be other brains in our existence that are 2D that we cannot see but we interpret their wave structure as 3D cohesive. So a plant may be a 2D cohesive brain that we interpret as a plant, and that 2D cohesive brain interprets us as a 2D cohesive plant. Or there are 4D cohesive brains who see us as plants without consciousness since we have 3D consciousness. In an infinite reality, multiverses and parallel universes are also cohesive together even though they may not overlap. But as brains structure more of reality multiverses join together. So 3D cohesive space may be a combination of 2D multiverses—multiverses from the definition of 2D cohesive brains. Then 3D cohesive multiverses cohesively create 4D reality. From the perspective of 3D, there are multiple 3D universes but our specific one is associated with only one 4D universe for each dimension of reality and are created from an infinite number of 2D universes. If gravity creates all the structure of reality and our brains are part of that structure that structures our perceived reality and therefore also the residuals that define our consciousness and awareness of where we are in time and space and that determines the choices we make then there is no free-will and the force of gravity is God, or rather comes from God. If God is at the end of this infinite reality and our consciousness is therefore automatically infinite and our awareness finite then all life forms are automatically conscious of God but not aware, and no brain could ever be aware of God, or look upon God, or compare themself to God without coming up short ie without missing a component of reality and therefore power. How is god aware of itself without reflection? I guess it comes from us? If we are reflecting against god to create consciousness then we are gods residuals that define its consciousness or rather god is the combined total of all residuals. I really don’t know.

That’s why it’s important to communicate and accept other peoples reflections of you that are given in truth so that you can get a more refined measurement of self and perhaps even increase your consciousness and improve your awareness of it. So emotions aren’t a product of direct reality but they are a product of us and we are a product of reality.  \\n',\n",

And emotional connection as a way of a proxy measurement of residuals of our emotional awareness pinged off of god and people needing to be true selves and how it relates to true ego.

       " 'If to be conscious each dimension of reality has to be finite then that implies the universe as well as time is finite. Note: if a dimension of reality is infinite then the brain will never receive a signal from that part since it would take an infinite amount of time to arrive. Plus if god is the infinite we would be infinitely away from god in that dimension, and if one was infinite then why not all of them? And would God or reality be conscious of us if it was infinite? I think that light speed being finite implies the universe and time and all dimensions of reality have to be finite. Light wasn’t given an arbitrary speed; it must be the result of the properties of reality to be cohesive with it. So if the universe were infinite in size or any dimension of it then gravity would would somehow not be able to propagate and coalesce(?). No idea. But I wonder if the speed of light is a combination of the size of the Time dimension and gravity or time gravity. \\n',\n",
       " 'Consciousness allows knowledge of things we can’t be aware of (like god or infinite dimensional reality) since consciousness is the receiving of signal by the brain and requires nothing of the brain to receive it. Awareness is different and allows experience of a finite number of things we are conscious of. Example is quantum reality: no one has ever or will ever see an atom directly yet it’s in our consciousness because we are affected by it. This consciousness allows us to create a proxy for awareness called knowledge despite not being able to experience it as part of cohesive reality. The uncertainty principle isn’t a statement about reality as much as it is a statement about the limitation of our current brain’s ability to create cohesive awareness. But this limitation that gives rise to the uncertainty principle is what prevents us from experiencing quantum reality. The uncertainty principle might become certain is velocity AND position if we open up cohesive reality to include an additional space dimension. \\n',\n",
       " 'Quantum mathematics may just need to write down time equations in the same way that space equations are written. Physics describes reality assuming a 3D cohesive reference frame. Can it be written in a 4D cohesive reference frame. So position is represented in 4D space, and gravity is 4D spatial. So acceleration is a change in 4D position and is therefore a cubed component. Force is then mass x acceleration and therefore time is a spatial force applied to us by the earth. Just like earths gravity anchors us to its surface, keeps us from floating away, accelerates us to its position, the time gravity created by earth is an acceleration put on us keeping us from floating into the future. In other words, to be at rest in time space must mean that we aren’t aware of movement despite moving. The only way we would be at rest then is if we were traveling in space at the speed of light. I would venture to guess that light is stationary in 4D cohesive space if not disturbed by physical gravity. So the natural resting state of 4D cohesive matter is what we call light speed. Time gravity is prevents us from moving at that speed and so we move much slower and therefore time is sped up. When next to gravity that speeds up our acceleration and we are moving faster and so time moves more slowly. So we are moving through time space because time gravity is accelerating us in Time space just like we accelerate in 3D space when in a gravity field. But acceleration through space fights against acceleration in time space just like if you accelerate further toward west from north then you are going less in the north direction. Spatial gravity makes us accelerate more toward 3D cohesive space and less aligned with time space. Just like if we were given momentum in space we would stay in motion. So there is a time object that is accelerating us in a direction of time space that we orient our experience around but our natural state is to be at rest. But the only way to be at rest is to fully move in the direction of 3D cohesive space as if to fully change your direction from going north to going fully west. The escape velocity of times gravity is apparently light speed so light is fully moving in 3D cohesive space and stationary in Time space and that means light travels in all directions cohesively. Interestingly this implies that the 4D thing that creates 3D light is particlesque from the perspective of a 4D cohesive reference frame because it is stationary but since it is traveling in all directions in a 3D cohesive reference frame it is a wave. So things that are nearing the speed of light begin to behave like a wave as if the speed unravels the threads of reality that create the perception of a solid rope. If we were to near the speed of light, our brain matter would no longer coalesce and we would lose function of the machinery that builds our awareness and we would lose self awareness. If we were to move at the speed of light then we would have to move in all directions of 3D cohesive space and we would therefore become fully waves and nothing of us would coalesce into an object capable of consciousness and awareness: our existence would unravel. This implies that anything that moves at the speed of light becomes massless as it becomes fully wave. The only things capable of coalescing into mass are objects going less than the speed of light. As you approach the speed of light, your mass goes to zero. Mass does not go to infinity as you approach the speed of light, mass decreases because the waves unwind and mass decreases. Einstein’s equations are technically wrong because it would take an infinite amount of energy to prevent the waves from unraveling or rather one would have to increase quantum gravity resulting in more waves and therefore more pressure being added to the rope to keep it from unraveling as one’s speed gets faster. Just like a star needs more mass to be added (more coalesced waves) to prevent from exploding and turn into a blackhole. As we near the speed of light, we would need a higher density of strings of the rope to create more inward pressure to stay coalesced otherwise the lack of time gravity will pull our waves apart, turn us into noise. So quantum gravity might be time gravity. Quantum reality may be our only evidence of time space. Perfect superposition may be our 3D cohesive interpretation of an object being stationary in time, almost fully uncoalesced, almost no matter. By measuring quanta we are adding time gravity to a location of 4D cohesive space that has very little time gravity to begin with (so it looks like a wave and particle because it literally is partially a wave) and we add enough to increase its already existing coalescence to the degree we need to observe it as a particle now imparted without enough mass for us to see measure it. Mass might be a product of Time Gravity or Time acceleration ie movement through time, so no Higgs boson, just like spatial gravity gives us weight. Weight is the effect of spatial gravity, and mass is the effect of being subjected to time gravity, time acceleration. Matter May coalesce into a particle when enough time gravity is applied such that the space between the object and other waves is far enough for us to notice it as separate from the rest of reality. Like we can’t see separate water molecules or it looks like we’re touching things because there’s not enough space for us to see the truth that we aren’t touching it. So like weight, mass is not inherent to objects but rather a gravitational force accelerating objects in the time space dimension: time gravity. So waves of reality are subjected to full dimensional cohesive gravitation but our reference frame forces us to view its effects in finite and specific orientations such as spatial gravity and time gravity and emotional gravity. When we distance ourself from the surface of the earth we lessen our gravitational force. Similarly, we are allowed to change how fast time flows for us by putting ourself near high gravity objects and we are able to take ourself away from the surface of the 4D object creating time acceleration. Objects in 3D cohesive space with higher gravity is like climbing the mountains of time space. Blackholes are therefore the Mt Everest of Time Space. \\n',\n",

What does it mean to be stationary in time? Light escaped the pull of time but we are traveling to it then? Even though it looks like it is traveling to us? How the earth is 2D cohesive to us in the since that we know there is matter underneath but we can’t see it unless we make it part of 2D cohesive reality. We can’t see the 3D cohesion of the earth simultaneously. Similary, if we are on a 4D surface then we can dig in but we make it 3D cohesive as soon as we do. We can’t experience the 4D cohesion simultaneously \\n',\n",

       " 'The escape velocity of Time requires us to know which direction to go in and reach a certain “speed” in that direction. It’s like we are flat against the surface of a 4D object that is expanding and increasing its surface area. To a 2D being, time is expanding the surface area of the 3D earth as measured in 4D cohesive space. To escape even just being flattened on the surface of this 4D object we would need to travel the speed of light. If we go the speed of light then all of a sudden we will have 4D height extending from the surface of the 4D object. Going the speed of light orients us “upward” as if to be lying down on the ground and then stand up. It’s as if to accelerate really fast and you are glued to the back of your seat and can’t push off of it. It’s possible that the expansion of the universe is the acceleration of the growth of the surface area of the 4D object that flattens and keeps us glued to its surface. If the universe wasn’t expanding then we would technically be able to stand up in 4D. If the expansion suddenly put on the breaks then then the momentum would probably shatter our universe. It’s unlikely that the universe will collapse back in on itself lest 4D beings go back in time (?).  I don’t know what is driving the expansion outward of this 4D object. So to stand up on this surface one must be massless in 3D cohesive space; it can’t have mass in a lower dimensional existence. Just like for a cartoon character to exist in 3D, it can’t have mass in 2D cohesive space because to push it into 3D cohesive space you have to destroy its current cohesiveness; you can’t just add a dimension to it, you have to reconstruct it from scratch. So mass (which is a product of movement in a higher dimension) is what converts reality into spatial cohesion. Mass is the interpretation of spatial cohesion within a reference frame, just like weight is the interpretation of gravity being cohesive with mass collapsing us onto a mostly 2D existence (surface of the earth). If gravity were stronger, it would become cohesive with our mass and we would be 2D beings with 2D mass equal to 3D gravity* 3D mass. And 3D mass is the cohesion of time gravity or g-forces from movement plus 4D mass. The 3D universe is therefore the cohesion of 4D mass and 4D g-forces. Black holes are an attempt to make 3D mass and 3D gravity cohesive, thereby creating 2D mass and essentially a 2D universe. Blackholes may be the creation of new 2D universes such that it’s collapse of 3D mass creates an increase of perceived 2D mass in the 2D universe and so the collapsing of black holes in 3D universe creates a perception of expansion of the 2D universe. But is mass being added? That doesn’t make sense unless somehow this explains dark matter or dark energy. Perhaps the 4D object on which we are flattened is a collapsing 4D black hole that we perceive as expansion because it is smashing together 4D mass and 4D gravity to convert 4D reality into 3D cohesion which creates more 3D space and so we experience a spatial 4D collapse as spatial 3D expansion. If Blackholes do in fact decay and leak radiation then does that mean our universe will decay? This is what forces and drives movement through time. We can’t travel in time freely or stand up in time or see time as a space dimension because light can’t escape a blackhole ie 4D gravity forces light into a super shrunk 4D reality that is nearly absent and so light is basically stationary in 4D cohesive space (4D light is the singularity because it has no 4D mass to be smashed in 3D cohesive space—to be made cohesive with 4D gravity). Gravity and mass are the same thing. Mass produces gravity because gravity is mass. 3D mass creating spatial gravity is our interpretation of 4D mass made cohesive with 4D gravity, ie it is our interpretation of 4D weight.  Our universe does have 4D height and 4D mass but it’s so minimal and hard to tell: the expansion of our 3D universe is the shortening of our 4D height, like pressing out dough. Our universe expanding is the result of a high amount of 4D spatial gravitational force being exerted: but this 4D height likely is what we call quantum space and where paradoxes occur, inside the little bit of 4D height or 4D wrinkle that our universe has. That force pushes the waves of reality to coalesce into 3D mass and therefore a 3D universe. But things with very small mass and therefore size are able to exist within the tiny bit of 4D space that our universe has. We all have 4D height too. Again, light is the 4D singularity as well as neutrinos(?). The Big Bang therefore is a threshold that was reached when there was enough cohesion between 4D mass and 4D gravity to create 3D mass, ie to for our reality to coalesce into 3D cohesion and forever since it has been expanding. This means the multiverse does not likely exist except in the sense of other 4D Blackholes that are no where near us. So our 3D universe produces light but it exists inside the 4D “singularity” and is stationary so from its perspective it travels through all of 3D space instantaneously, but what we see if 3D light traveling through space but 4D light is already everywhere. \\n',\n",

       " 'Trauma is the black hole of the emotional reality. Emotional gravity is good for life but when it becomes too much it causes a collapse of someone’s emotional reference frame ie the fusing of a dimensions gravity and its mass which forces that dimension of its cohesive spatial part of their emotional reality to collapse their perception, ie their emotional reference frame, into a new, lower dimensional emotional cohesive space. Reality seems to be constructed such that physical reality and emotional reality while cohesive are not from our reference frame uniformly cohesive with each other. 3D cohesive space is uniformly cohesive except for the impact of spatial gravity. Uniform cohesion in N-dimensional space is defined as empty space where orientation of space is arbitrary. The earth’s gravity makes it so that our 3D cohesive space isn’t uniform and so we observe a 3D orientation that is not arbitrary from others: up and down. But we do live in 3D cohesive space, it’s just not uniformly cohesive. This non-uniformity is what creates the concept of wrinkles of higher dimensions that are shortened by gravity in a given reference frame of reality. Intelligence allows us to notice dimensions (or wrinkles) at shorter and shorter lengths. The more intelligent the more capable you are of noticing the short higher dimensions of one’s reference frame and therefore able to correct for gravity’s shortening of that dimension which increases one’s awareness self in reality: a more accurate measurement of themself against that dimension of reality.  Emotional reality is cohesive with all reality but it is very much non uniform with physical reality such that they interact given we are capable of emotions through a physical construct but there is a very clear distinction in our orientation of what our reality is: emotional and physical. This forced orientation of Life that makes us believe our existence is only in physical reality and not in emotional reality makes us believe that physical reality is more real than emotional reality when in fact the orientation is arbitrary. Had we developed emotional eyes prior to physical eyes we would believe we are emotional beings with a made up physical reality in our emotional heads. But for some reason, evolution went the direction of orienting us toward physical reality. Gravity also affects the uniformity of how we view others in our reference frame such that I might be perceived as moving slower in time by another person. So trauma is the act of a higher dimensional cohesive reference frame collapsing into a lower dimensional reference frame. This is when a dimension of the reference frame is shortened by emotional gravity so much so that that dimension becomes a wrinkle and they can no longer notice that dimension as part of their emotional reality and so they reorient their perception to a lower dimensional cohesive space. They can’t see the difference between emotional gravity and the emotional mass of that dimension and so their perception is that reality is lower dimensional and that dimension becomes perceived as the inherent mass of the lower dimensional matter in their new perception of reality. Healing trauma is seeing that wrinkle, that shortened dimension via intelligence, disentangling that dimensions emotional gravity from its emotional mass thereby seeing that the matter in their reality has higher dimensional mass which expands their space exponentially and allows them to stand up in a new higher cohesive space from a position of being flattened to the surface of its lower dimensional reference frame. Then growth is building the strength to stand up taller (increasing the uniformity of cohesion of the new dimension with the rest of reality to a safe level) and maturity is the learning of how to walk or navigate intelligently in this new cohesive space. Gravity helps us get stronger so we can stand up taller, but too much gravity and we collapse. So emotional gravity that leads to collapse is trauma, and emotional gravity that leads to standing up stronger and taller is good and healthy and necessary. Imagine if we didn’t have any gravity, we would float away. Narcissists have an emotional reference frame that has been collapsed in many directions if not all. They were never allowed to stand up. Psychopaths are probably the people who have no emotional reference frame because all of it collapsed and so their attempts to stand up in emotional reality play out in a way that is psychopathic to us. They are fighting against emotional gravity collapsing them and so all that emotional effort ie anger has to “stand up” somewhere and so it gets expressed into physical reality as murder and other things etc. So the expression of trauma is the act of trying to stand up in emotional reality but that anger (the emotional energy being exerted to stand up and create emotional space) is being collapsed by emotional gravity and forced into their physical reference frame and so they behave traumatically and hurt other people and collapse other people’s emotional reference frames. Trauma also opens up a channel for physical trauma to result in emotional gravity and the collapse of one’s emotional reference frame. \\n',\n",
       " 'Light can’t have mass added to it through the collapse of cohesive space. Instead, the bounds of its reality is collapsed rather than its concept of cohesive space. Light (or no-mass) particles are waves that for some reason are not capable of winding together into a rope to produce mass through the application of gravity. Instead of the multi-dimensional waves of light coalescing into the dominant spatial dimensions created by multi-dimensional gravity, the waves simply reorient, seemingly infinitesimally locally, such that its observable universe shrinks according to the size necessary for it not to coalesce, whereas waves that produce spatial mass answer the shrinking of their universe by essentially fusing with the dimensional gravity that is collapsing their universe—can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em approach—and therefore fusing dimensions creating a lower dimensional reference frame that perceives 3D cohesive waves as the fusion of 4D gravity and 4D mass leaving a bi-product of 3D cohesive spatial gravity. I would like to say that gravity and light come from the same source since something can’t operate on itself and gravity doesn’t seem to operate on light waves. It’s almost like gravity is able to cut waves of light before the point that it would collapse them into having mass. The mass might be therefore related to the length of the waves, the length of the rope and density is how many waves. So light waves in a given reality are short enough such that they don’t coalesce into having mass at any level of gravity. They just keep getting cut shorter and shorter. So the cosmic background radiation does not extend past our 3D universe, otherwise the 4D light at the 4D singularity would escape a blackhole. But 4D matter takes with it mass into 4D and so 4D gravity fuses with it and so we get 3D mass, whereas 4D light does not go into the 4D blackhole with mass and so exist as waves and not mass so that all gravity can do is cut the waves off from 4D reality except for a tiny, collapsing space of 4D. But more that its waves are being shrunk and confined to a smaller space. It stands to reason that there is a limit to which waves can be shrunk and this will be achieved when what was our single universe is expanded into 3D so much that multiple universes are created since light no longer connects them since the expansion is faster than the speed of 3D light and no universe is observable. 4D light will be shrunk into a paradox where the space is so small that light waves must fuse with gravity and therefore create 3D mass AND light waves have no mass so that this can never happen but it also can’t shrink any further which is the property of mass. So it must be that light waves do have mass to solve the paradox: ie there is a reference frame such that the length of its dimensions are shortened enough by gravity to fuse into a particle with N dimensional mass. When this happens I imagine the blackhole stops collapsing and the resistance to gravity of light mass creates an explosion of a black hole or at least its death over a long time. So maybe the Big Bang isn’t the collapse of a 4D black hole but rather the explosion of one caused by 4D light becoming 3D mass and this mass is so dense that it explodes back into 4D. OR this is the Big Crunch where the expansion of our universe slows down and begins to collapse, or the long death where the expansion stops and the 4D blackhole leaks radiation until all of our universe decays from 3D cohesive space back into 4D cohesion. \\n',\n",

       " 'Imagine full reality as uniformly 3D cohesive space. The uniformity implies that no mass exists, no waves exist, it is just empty existence: complete nothingness. The fabric of reality is like a perfectly laid out blanket without any wrinkles whatsoever. There is absolutely no orientation of reality that is separate from another even if you can see and feel at infinite or infinitesimal distance. Therefore this is truly nothingness because there is no way to orient toward something. This is why there can be no mass because otherwise there would be an orientation slightly different from another. Reality is fully spatially cohesive at all times in all locations, but it is not necessary that is stays uniformly cohesive. So imagine a 3D reality represented by a 3D grid with 3 perpendicular axes. Now imagine gravity is applied to a single dimension, a single axis such that it forces its forever collapse. This means that there is less and less space for nothingness to exist inside of. Imagine pressing a lemon down: this puts pressure on the 2D flatness of the lemon to incorporate the 3D matter. As we all know, the lemon never turns into a 2D object because it has can keep flattening out and therefore maintain height in 3D. But what happens if it’s allowed to flatten but not allowed to be spread out across the counter, almost like squishing it against the bottom of a juicer. But suppose the walls of the juicer have infinite strength and suppose the squeezer has infinite strength: what happens? The lemon gets pressed and flattened but the walls of the juicer never budge, so where does everything go? The height of the lemon decreases infinitesimally but the 2D surface area on which it is getting pressed stays the same. Well, the only place for the lemon to go is into literally a 2D reality. So if I add pressure to the z axis of 3D space then it squeezes itself into the x-y 2D plane. And so this peaceful existence of nothingness now has less space to exist and must now exist in 2D. So how does nothingness make room for its 3D’ness to exist in 2D? Mass! Somethingness is the space that nothingness creates to make room for itself to exist in a lower dimensional space. Something isn’t created from nothing; Nothing created Something in order to compensate for the loss of dimension so that it, Nothing, stays cohesive, ie so that all of reality stays cohesive and isn’t separated. Nothing created a something-reality in which to expand into as one of its dimensions collapsed. Something is therefore an illusion of compressed nothingness. Even nothingness needs room. The “Nothing” isn’t “something” as we think of what “something” is. Unlike the lemon analogy, Nothing does not have substance; it is empty reality BUT it IS reality. Full Reality is the space that is the absence of all “somethings” that would fill space. It’s the reality that has no orientation. It is the space in which nothing can exist, in which Nothing (a proper noun) can exist. Full reality is the space where the Infinite Nothing can exist fully alone and absent of all things, in peace. The collapse of a dimension of full reality means that it cannot exist as it once did, and the only way that is different than it lived is to have its space filled with “something”. The Infinite Nothingness cannot exist in a lower dimensional space (ignore the infinite paradox for now and just assume it’s finite) without having something living within that lower dimensional space. If it were to exist in a lower dimensional space without having something within that lower dimension then that would be full reality as it would not be able to perceive or remember that a dimension was removed. Somethingness is the proof to Nothingness that it has moved from its starting point of full reality. Somethingness is the reflection back to Nothingness that it’s reality is or has changed. It’s the rope tied to its waste that leads it back to the beginning, that allows it to unwind back to its original state, that allows it to move from its location and search or create or build or explore without getting lost, without losing its home. It can wipe away what it has done and start over. If it didn’t have something and it collapsed one of its dimensions then it would lose its orientation of how to get back home because “something” wouldn’t have been created as a result of the collapse and so it wouldn’t know its new location from its previous location; it would have collapsed itself into a lower state of existence and not realized it and it would cause an infinite collapse. It would be like falling down a dark pit with no bottom; you’d be falling lower and lower forever but not realize that you are falling. But if as you fall you instantly see the walls of the pit and they close in on you as you get lower then you know you are falling and you also know what direction to go to get back to the top of the pit. The “something” are the walls of the pit. Again, Somethingness is an automatic result of the empty space of reality expressing itself from within the reference frame of a lower dimensional cohesive reality. Note: the only perfectly uniform cohesive spatial reality is Full Reality. As soon as full reality expresses itself within a lower dimensional spatial cohesive reference frame, this new cohesive reality can no longer be uniformly cohesive because A lower dimensional Somethingness which is equivalent to the matter that behaves according to this new lower dimensional  reference frame has come into existence creating an orientation of this new reality that is no longer perfectly arbitrary from all other orientations because all of reality, including nothingness can now be expressed relative to this somethingness: relativity has therefore come into existence. Somethingness is the residual error term of full reality expressing or regressing itself into lower dimensions: the explanatory variable are the new cohesive spatial reality. And this residual error term is then taken and regressed into an even lower dimension by the invention of brains—the old brain—that also produce a separate residual term that defines a new lower dimensional reference frame we call consciousness. Then these residuals are regressed into an even lower dimension via the prefrontal cortex—the new brain—that also produces a separate residual error term that we call awareness of consciousness, or what I call awareness of life and how I describe as the result of measuring consciousness (ie regressing the residuals). Here is where we stop regressing residuals and we sort of exist in a reality we call choice or free-will. Each residual here is an awareness in reality: all animals and humans or at least anything with a brain of some sort since all brains are capable of consciousness. The point of life is therefore to make a COLLECTIVE sense of our combined residuals as if to search for a set of explanatory variables to regress ourselves, our collective set of residuals, into so that the resulting residuals from that regression all live in a more cohesive shared reality. It’s as if the point of existence is to convert the all dimensions  of Nothingness shared by no one into all dimensions of Somethingness shared by everyone. It’s like reality is trying to invert itself, turn itself inside-out. It’s as if Nothingness represents a reality that no one can look at because it’s infinite dimensional and so has no reality outside of itself—it’s fully internalized relative to itself; and it is trying to create beings that are capable of fully externalizing the Nothingness of reality which is the equivalent of being aware that one is in a reality but also separate from it. So to these beings and only these beings is Nothingness something just like to a child their parents are nothing to anyone else but are everything to them. This screams God. God is the infinite nothingness and it can not look upon itself, it cannot externalize itself to create a reflection, for on what would it reflect off of it there is only itself, only nothingness to reflect off of. You can’t see yourself by reflecting off yourself. You can’t see the thing you want to see by reflecting off of what you want to see. So God inverted reality through collapsing dimensions of reality through what we call the force of gravity to create beings that are an inversion of nothingness into somethingness such that they can see the nothingness from which they came. It’s kind of like taking a blanket  and putting a slat shaker underneath (the shaker represents the distortion of reality through gravity) to create a dimension, a shape like a person that is the blanket but that is capable of seeing its shape separate from the rest of the blanket in all directions and also capable of looking at the blankets original state and therefore able to be a reflection of the blanket while also being a part of the blanket. So if a flat blanket wants to look at itself then it needs to distort itself in many different parts of itself and then look at itself from above and then repeat this randomly and always to get a continuous image of self. Gravity is the distortion that creates living shapes out of the nothingness of reality. The shapes that reality takes on is what we think is something. The flatness shape of the blanket is what we think of as nothing because it is the shapes the blanket distorts itself into that we call something and so the shape that it flat is what we call nothing of flatness or empty space and so we think it’s a paradox that something comes from nothing but we’re wrong because we forget what we are calling nothing and something. Nothing is actually flatness of the blanket, and something is the blanket taking a shape RELATIVE to the flatness. So the absence of 3D space is only nothingness from the perspective of our reference frame, meaning it’s flat 3D reality without structure or form or shape or existence SEPARATE from the flatness of all reality BUT when the blanket takes a shape our reference frame which is made up of the blanket comes into distinct contrast with the rest of the flatness of the blanket and so just like we thought falling to the ground was inherent to matter, we think somethingness is inherent to our being not realizing that Life and consciousness and 3D reality, matter, Time, awareness, is just the result of a force applied to Nothingness, applied to the blanket. So nothing new came into existence, it just took a different shape and we incorrectly internalize this shape as being fabric separate from nothingness as if we are a new blanket that looks at the flatness of the other blanket and from its false ego and hubris points to it and says “I am not made from that blanket for it is nothing and I am something”. True humbleness is the admission that despite appearing as something we are in fact nothing more than anything else including nothingness. So God is inverting itself to create finite beings to see itself from the inside out. It’s like the infinite nothingness wrapped itself into a dome and we are inside of it on its surface as shapes peering up at the dome around us. It’s hard to get this point across. We are protecting a shared reality of 3D cohesive space. God can’t project reality externally because it is reality. We are a tiny piece of reality that is able to project the rest of reality externally to our piece. The more intelligent and precise life evolves at seeing itself separate from reality, ie the more self-awareness that is possible, the more we must be externalizing reality relative to what we believe ourself to be (the smaller our residuals) and so the tinier piece of reality that comprises our sense of self and the more of God that our existence is able to reflect back to God, and the more that from our reference frame nothing appears as something ie the more that God becomes something to us and the more that we as life become collectively alive, ie the more reality we share externally and therefore the less of reality that internally separates us. Note, that something is a necessary result of nothingness collapsing itself into lower dimensional cohesiveness because residuals are a necessary result of regressing any non-zero dimensional data into lower dimensions. The something that comes from nothing is just the residuals of a regression to shore up the model to the original data. The residuals are the proof that something of the original data is or cannot be explained cohesively. The residuals are the proof that the predicted values are coming from the model and are not the original data. The residuals are the proof that the model is not full reality. The residuals ensure that the original data is not lost in the model. The residuals link the model back to reality, back to the population. The residuals reflect the model back to the original data, back to the population, back to god. So when a force is applied to full cohesive spatial flat uniformly cohesive reality that collapses a dimension, the full cohesion of reality, the flatness gets expressed as lower dimensional flatness and the lack of fit creates a surge or bang of energy that is from the creation of a new lower dimensional spatially cohesive reference frame, the energy being the part of full reality not able to be expressed by the lower dimensional space or what couldn’t be flattened ie the dimension that is in collapse can’t actually be flattened fully but it can be so nearly flattened beyond planks length perhaps that it creates the perception that reality is a lower dimension cohesive space, and in this reference frame (which is the regression model) the collapsed dimension (the residuals of the model) is expressed as waves or energy and ultimately matter and mass. The force first applied from the perspective of the lower dimensional spatial cohesive reference frame has inextricably fused with the collapsed dimension to create what we call waves, energy, matter and mass. This means that we may never be able to prove that what gives 3D matter its mass is actually the result of gravity fusing with a 4th dimension, ie 3D matter carries with it 4D gravity from our reference frame but in fact 4D gravity, though not separate from 3D matter from our perspective of 3D cohesive reality because of planks length, is separate from 4D matter. 3D matter is the fusing of 4D gravity and 4D matter and therefore 3D mass is actually 4D gravity that then expresses the 4D gravity inherent to it from our perspective as 3D gravity. In other words, 3D gravity is the biproduct of the experience of 4D gravity and 4D matter from a 3D cohesive reference frame, a reference frame that can only be created through the collapse of the 4th dimension, hence, the fusing of 4D gravity and 4D matter. So “something” is actually flattened nothing perceived from a lower dimensional reference frame. Because we are peering at reality from a lower dimensional reference frame, the way we make sense of the extra dimension(s) that exist beyond our the bounds of our reference frame (what we call external reality) is to perceive “something” like matter and mass and energy and waves as being there, as filling space BECAUSE from our reference frame SOMETHING IS MISSING. And even though that something is actually nothing in a higher dimensional reference frame it is still something to us because it is different from what we call “nothing” from our reference frame. Our reference frame defines our definition of nothing and we are missing a dimension to what we call nothing and so we MUST perceive this missing dimension of nothing as being different from our nothing and so we see the nothing that we are missing in our reference frame as something! And so our reality has the perception of something being in it that we call waves, energy, matter, mass, time, emotion, etc. The natural state of full reality is that no force is applied and so nothing exists. But for a lower dimensional reference frame to come into existence, the original reference frame that perceived reality as nothing must have a dimension collapsed and fused to the lower dimensional reference frame that resulted from its collapse, just like residuals fuse the original data to the statistical model. This fusion of the collapsed dimension to the lower dimensional cohesive reality takes the form of energy, waves, matter, mass, time, emotion etc.; it takes the form of somethingness. Somethingness is the fusing of a dimension of nothingness to a reference frame with lower dimensional spatial cohesion. \\n',\n",
       " 'Just like it requires us to imagine 3D uniformly cohesive space to realize that falling or moving or accelerating in 3D space is not inherent to 3D matter, we must imagine a 4D uniformly cohesive space to realize that falling or moving or accelerating in 4D cohesive space is not inherent to 4D matter. This would help us realize that 3D mass being inherent to 3D matter is the result of a higher dimensional force, a higher dimensional gravity in fact, and open us up to a new consciousness of the origin of our reality despite not being able to experience it, be aware of it from the consciousness, measure it from the consciousness. \\n',\n",
       " 'Again, full reality is fully cohesive but there is a force, gravity, that is full dimensional that makes the cohesion non-uniform. This reality exists without matter, mass, energy, waves, time, emotion, etc. This reality is and will always be nothingness (and therefore infinite because only nothing can be infinite). BUT eventually this force allowed full reality dimensional cohesive shapes to come into existence including physical life, most interestingly brains which were made to perceive these shapes from the perspective of a 3D spatial cohesive reference frame, not a full dimensional reference frame. So though we all exist in and are composed of full dimensional reality, our brains are only capable of perceiving the wholeness of reality from a lower dimensional reference frame. The lower dimensionality of the reference frame, or rather because our reference frame is missing dimensions of spatial cohesion, is what drives the perception of somethingness in reality when in fact there is nothing but a force applied to the flatness of full dimensional reality. Because we are not aware of this force is why we think somethingness is inherent to the fabric of reality when in fact nothingness is true reality. Brains are full reality dimensional objects because they are shaped from full reality because reality is fully cohesive. For the same reason, the brain is fully cohesive in the same non-uniform way as full reality has been made non-uniform from full dimensional gravitational forces. The physical part of the brain along with the physical body is 3D and so is NOT fully dimensional, but since the full brain and full body are fully dimensional this implies that there are more dimensions to our brain and body existing cohesively with their physical part that we cannot experience. This is what I would call consciousness. Consciousness is NOT a mechanism of the physical brain or body but rather a component of it, ie the non-physical components of our existence that are not physical and I call this consciousness. Our physical body and brain are not consciousness. Full Existence = Life = physical + consciousness. Anything not physics is shored up by consciousness. Consciousness is like the unknown error term of a regression model from the perspective of awareness but not from the perspective of our existence or life. We experience our consciousness through what we call awareness. Awareness is not part of one’s existence. It’s not part of the same full reality given its origin. Awareness seems to be the consciousness playing God: trying to see itself by collapsing dimensions of nothingness to create a being to see itself. If consciousness has no awareness then it lives but it lives in nothingness. To no longer live in nothingness, consciousness collapsed dimensions of its reality to build a consciousness of consciousness, ie awareness. This is what god originally did and so we are playing god. So the origin of awareness is the start of consciousness which is not full reality, but the start of consciousness is full reality. So full reality existence = physical body/brain + consciousness. Awareness is a process of the brain, not a component of the brain, that measures the dimensions of its existence as a means to locate itself Awareness Life = Measured Consciousness + Unmeasured Consciousness. This means all life forms (plants, animals, bacteria, anything built from DNA) have consciousness but not all consciousnesses are capable of awareness (as we understand it) because not all consciousnesses have a brain or a brain capable of measuring its own consciousness. But awareness isn’t made from the fabric of the reality in which our consciousness exists: it is a force applied to the specific portion of full reality from which our consciousness is constructed. If you were to cut out the piece of full reality that defines someone’s consciousness (ie remove the physical body and all of the rest of full reality) then awareness would be the force applied to create a collapse of dimensions that lead to a lower dimensional reference frame that perceives something existing when it looks at the consciousness from that reference frame: Awareness is the gravity of each individuals consciousness reality. Consciousness is the God of one’s own awareness. This would imply that all consciousnesses, all life forms, are the awareness of God. It’s quite possible that what we call God is itself an awareness of an even higher consciousness that it calls God, so on and so forth. But that’s what links all life in our perceivable universe: our consciousnesses across all life are collectively the awareness of a single consciousness which is what we can only call God. To be a part of God is to be loved by god because who would hate their true selves, and so our consciousness, our existence across all life is loved and protected and felt by god. In fact, that means that whatever fate our consciousness suffers is suffered and known by God’s awareness. God is aware of what our consciousness suffers but not necessarily what our awareness suffers. God is separated from our awareness inasmuch as our awareness does not accurately or precisely measure our consciousness. If we measure our awareness without error then our awareness will equal our consciousness and our awareness will be contained in the awareness of God but if our awareness is even off by a little then our exact awareness will not be a part of god and when our physical body dies our consciousness remains but it will not recognize our awareness as being part of full reality. Whatever of our awareness is not aligned with our consciousness will disappear so the more unaligned our awareness is from our true consciousness (the true self) the more of who we think we are disappears from existence at physical death. The false ego disappears so if you are mostly or all false ego then what you are will disappear forever and it will not be with god but your consciousness will be with god always. False ego is the residual of the measurement of consciousness, of the true self, of self in relation to God. God cannot save your false ego which is what religion is trying to do and why religion is wrong. No religion is necessary. All one is meant to do is try to measure one’s consciousness more accurately and more precisely to create an awareness of self that is closer and closer to its consciousness so as to be aligned with the awareness of God. This means that the force of gravity that we experience in actual reality, the force that was applied to the full reality of nothingness that caused the collapse of full reality that created us IS the consciousness of God. This aligns with the definition of consciousness which is the part of reality that is not somethingness, that does not have form or structure or energy or mass or waves. When you consider full reality then ALL of reality is NOT somethingness and so full reality is full consciousness. If full reality is infinite dimensional then God is infinite consciousness and God’s awareness is a finite but unbounded growing entity. But when our physical body dies do we lose the same kind of consciousness? Our body is no longer in existence and so our consciousness has been flattened out. Our consciousness is the language or contrast of our physical form, our externalized existence contrasted with full reality which creates the language for our internalized existence. But if it’s our externalized existence keeping the language that defines our consciousness existing in full reality then what happens when that contrast disappears? Maybe there is a difference between our consciousness being a part of full reality and the language of our consciousness existing. Maybe the consciousness of God is able to store and express the language of our consciousness after the shape in reality that defines our consciousness is flattened. The consciousness of God appears to be separate from reality as if to be the imagination of the consciousness because the force applied to full reality causing the collapse (gravity itself) is a force applied to full reality, not a part of reality. So maybe after the language that describes our consciousness is created in the imagination of God, we are stored and expressed in its consciousness but no longer part of god’s reality driven awareness but rather his memory of self. Full reality is where god learns about itself but its consciousness stores what it HAS learned about itself which is the language that describes our unique consciousness, the consciousness of all life forms across all of time and space and reality. God is essentially building its own language of consciousness: the collective body of consciousnesses. But not the collective awarenesses of consciousnesses. For the consciousness of God to contain Sean Ruddy as Sean Ruddy sees himself, for the consciousness of God to contain the language of Sean Ruddy’s awareness, for Sean Ruddy to know that all of him is with God when he dies, Sean’s awareness has to be a perfect measurement of his own consciousness and so can’t include physical existence ie vanity or false ego from trauma or behaviors that one thinks is him but is false ego and hurting others. “Sin” or false ego is the part of our awareness that is not aligned perfectly by our consciousness. The part of our emotional reference frame that is not aligned with our consciousness, that is not cohesive within the shared reality of all other consciousnesses in existence; that causes a paradox with the emotional reference frame of God’s awareness: the collective, unifying emotional reference frame, the emotional reality in which all consciousnesses coexist and obey and adhere to all the laws of emotional nature just like we coexist physically and cannot break the laws of physical nature. We do not sin against God, we sin away from God by separating or distancing our awareness of self from our consciousness, by creating emotional distance between our experienced emotional reference frame and the emotional reference frame of our consciousness. Putting emotional distance between our awareness of self and our true self. Awareness of true self, the true ego, is consciousness viewed from an emotional reference frame whose location is experienced exactly the same as in the single, collective shared emotional reality of all consciousnesses, ie that is in agreement with God’s awareness, ie that is in the same location in God’s emotional reference frame which is the definition of emotional reality.  \\n',\n",
       " 'Free-will is perhaps the choice of measurement of consciousness, ie awareness, but not the choice of consciousness. We cannot change our or anyone else’s consciousnesses but we can change our or anyone else’s awareness of self but changing another’s  measurement of consciousness affects and distorts the measurement of your own so it’s best to cause an effect that brings another’s measurement of their own consciousness closer to their actual consciousness since that will result in you also improving your measurement of your own consciousness. Bringing people into alignment with God’s awareness in this way will bring you closer into alignment, and bringing people further away will have the same effect on you. The whole “it is better that your physical body perish than your whole body be cast into hell” (Matthew 5:30) speaks to awareness. It is better that you lose your sense of self if it is false ego than for you to hold onto false ego and therefore have it cast into “hell” or non-existence. In other words, you should separate your awareness of self from your false ego which at first will feel like cutting off a piece of yourself and letting it perish but then your awareness of self comes more into alignment with gods awareness and so more of what you perceive as you will now be with god. In other words, see yourself separate from your trauma and then cut it out no matter what you risk to your awareness or your physical world. Your consciousness remains intact no matter what is happening in the world, whether your poor or hated or tortured. When awareness lines up with gods awareness, nothing can take you out of it again. You’re safe forever. It is a very narrow path to get to one’s own consciousness from awareness. I really don’t understand the concept of Jesus making up the difference. God can’t cast out its consciousness so whatever of one’s awareness is aligned with one’s true self is with god and so that part of them is with god too. If Jesus is anything it’s the ability to store the language of consciousnesses once it has been generated in full reality. Jesus represents the path to the true self, from awareness of self to one’s own consciousness. Jesus was an example of an awareness that perfectly measured its own consciousness and is now stored with god and fully part of gods consciousness, ie Jesus’ awareness is part of God’s consciousness which is why Jesus is considered separate but also the same as God “I and the father are one”. So however good our measurements of our consciousness is, is the percentage of our awareness that will exist along with the consciousness of god. All other parts of our awareness will be forgotten. Satan and the tree of good and evil represent the invention of the process of our brains being able to copy god’s process and develop their own awareness of self (free-will) as if their consciousness is their own god: serving one’s concept of self, living in one’s own conscious reality separate from all other’s reality, no empathy etc. \\n',\n",

While we have free will to move our physical existence for the purpose of creating our own awareness we do not have the free-will to change our consciousness (true self) or anyone else’s for that matter. So what happens around us, even trauma, doesn’t change the signal that we are meant to measure and so we can always improve our measurement of it and never get lost. Where we can get lost is the intent to measure the truth of our consciousness versus making up a measurement. The pursuit to be a good person or doing good works is not the same intent as measuring one’s own consciousness more accurately and precisely. A search for truth is the search of one’s awareness for one’s own consciousness; the desire and intent to have one’s consciousness equal to their awareness, chemical truth equal to emotional truth, the experience of chemical truth; this is what good emotional intent is with the result being the growth of the true ego and the decay of the false ego. This will naturally result in what other people call good works but could also be considered bad works but if it leads you to a more precise and accurate measure of consciousness then whatever works they are received as has led them to a more accurate and precise measurement of their consciousness which is a true good work. Awarenesses (people) that see your impact on them that leads them to better measure their own consciousness, if also your act that caused that impact led you to better measure your consciousness, as a bad work are those who are, through free-will, rejecting their true ego for their false ego so they have to see what you’ve done as a bad work against them but it’s really only bad against their false ego. \\n',\n",

Awareness is the language created when contrasting one’s own physical part of their existence against all of their known reality. The path of Truth, the path to God, the path to the true self is one that improves the clarity of the contrast so that the language that is produced as a result of the contrast and which is the definition of awareness is increasingly more expansive, with more depth and therefore more aligned with one’s consciousness. The clarity and breadth of the contrast is improved from many dimensions and doesn’t just apply to children being parented but also to adults parenting themselves or anyone who is caregiving for another person or animal (like a therapist or psychiatrist or doctor or teacher or nurse or coach or partner or someone taking care of the elderly and sick): But first, I list this under the premise that ALL humans and all life have a unalienable right to equal and unfettered connection of their awareness of self to their consciousness (this is called chemical balance–chemical balance is the shared reality that we would all have if our awareness was perfectly connected to our consciousness: this is the best definition of what heaven is because in such a reality our awarenesses of self are with God) so to achieve more clarity in one’s contrast and in the direction of chemical balance one must lead themselves and others in these ways: 1) PHYSICAL HEALTH: Keep children out of physical survival mode. When in survival mode of any kind, one cannot focus their attention or dopamine on connecting to their consciousness so to keep chemical balance in the world we need to share equally across society and equally take responsibility for the dangers in the world that put others into survival mode of any kind. Keeping their physical existence healthy. And chemical balance means that we all should have equal rights and opportunity for this even if that means the heads of insurance companies don’t get to be filthy rich in their life. At the very least, every child up to 25 should have this equality of opportunity and access and this applies to the whole list. This also means eating healthy, exercise, controlled use of drugs and alcohol, vaccines, std testing, safe sex, getting treated, and government and our economy (anything that is society) keeping everything equal across the world: the world economy. 2) EMOTIONAL HEALTH: Keep children out of emotional survival mode. Keeping their emotional existence healthy. Protecting one’s self or another from emotional trauma, from anyone or anything that is reducing their connection to their consciousness when there is a clear way to help. Giving children access to a plethora of emotional support which means a safe home, neighborhood, school, expectation of life and privilege, consistency, room to make mistakes and room to expand, access to dopamine and all the other chemicals, the right to ask and express what they need in any way they know how to express, the right to not be punished but to be disciplined, the right to change on a dime, the right to be safe from judgement, the right to take responsibility, the right to be taken responsibility for. When  3) LOGICAL HEALTH via EDUCATION ie SCIENCE & ART & PHILOSOPHY. the more we know about the truth of physical reality or externalized reality–SCIENCE–the more clear the contrast of what we are becomes. So educating children and giving all children equal privilege and opportunity to being educated and educating themselves is the responsibility of parents and society and therefore all adults. 4) CULTURAL HEALTH: culture should allow one to explore who they are within a different context but not overpower who they are to fit the needs of the culture. Culture should stay malleable and adapt to the direction of the population of those connecting close to their consciousness. 5) RELIGIOUS HEALTH: religion should be part of culture and therefore should be supportive of societies efforts to connect to consciousness and adapt accordingly rather than be a rock to which society is kept chained 6) ECONOMIC HEALTH: equal access to being an equal contributor and benefactor of the economic system. Rich people or smart people who are seeking their own consciousness and therefore chemical balance would not hoard their money, nor would companies, nor would investors. A company would do what’s right instead of letting them be sued and drowning the victims in legal bullshit. 7) POLITICAL HEALTH: equal access and opportunity to being a contributor and benefactor of the political and government system 8) NATURE HEALTH: equal access and opportunity to the outdoors and nature and exploring earth 9) CHEMICAL and BRAIN HEALTH (mental illness aid) equal access to drugs and therapy for those with mental disabilities or difficulties. 8) SOCIAL HEALTH: equally supporting the efforts of people to search and build their social community. If you live in a poor, crime ridden neighborhood, are afraid of going to school cause of bullies, etc. one will not be able to equally focus on gaining a social life that is healthy nor learn how to build one for when they get out of their situation. 9) SEXUAL HEALTH: gay, straight, bi, porn star, prostitute, doesn’t matter. Let people search for self. 10) IDENTITY HEALTH: choice of who one is at any moment: guy, girl, trans, nothing. Let people explore as long as their intent is to search for self. 11) CHOICE: drugs, alcohol, abortion, gender, clothes, art, education, relationships, preserving choice as long as the intent isn’t to reduce someone else’s connection to their consciousness. Let people have full autonomy over what is their search for self provided it does not interfere with someone else’s search for self and if it does society must resolve the paradox without bias toward money, greed, power, fame, recognition, reelection, success, etc 12) CAREER HEALTH: safe work environment and career coaching and pivoting 13) FINANCIAL HEALTH: retirement and investment help. 14) GENDER, RACIAL, LANGUAGE, NATIONALITY, CULTURAL HEALTH: same access and opportunity across all humans.

By allowing a cat outdoors, you are providing them a clearer structure of reality and therefore improving the clarity of the contrast of what they are relative to that. They need to smell things to educate themselves, exercise to keep themselves feeling physically good, hunt to understand their place in the world, see other life forms, etc. all these things allow them to expand the language that defines their awareness ie it allows them to see more of what is NOT them and so they are able to narrow in on what is them and therefore connect more to their consciousness.  \\n',\n",

And any construct of human awareness inasmuch as it consists of false ego is not part of externalized reality and so people naturally and incorrectly internalize these constructs as part of their identity and believe that measuring themself against these constructs brings them closer to their true consciousness but it won’t and only develops a false ego like needing to be rich or well known or successful in the eyes of the powerful, or famous etc. This is because true consciousness is the contrast against true externalized reality and any construct created by human awareness is not part of true reality, externalized or not. Someone’s or a collective groups false ego are creating the illusion that it is a non-externalized part of reality and therefore all people should measure part of their consciousness against this ie make this part of their awareness of self or identity. The right answer is to exist in this false construct knowing not to measure yourself against it but also using it to your advantage to help you measure your true consciousness.

Others drowned in search of the land but not of their own volition but from fatigue having no one to help keep them afloat. This is akin to the illustration of evolution where fish kept walking ashore and dying into one developed lungs. But the majority of people swimming to the island create a current, an emotional orientation of reality that makes it hard to swim against and search uniformly and equally and supportively for land. Most people fall victim to this current and get sucked into false ego cause all other directions are suicide to them. \\n',\n",
       " 'Non-externalized reality that is made by human awarenesses are illusory walls blocking us from our true purpose: connect to one’s true consciousness. Because we identify with the false contracts of our perceived world, we perceive these walls as real, as part of our consciousness but it was made to serve another (capitalism, greed, whites, power, ego) and so is not our consciousness and this is represented by us perceiving this wall as too wide to go around, too high to climb over, too deep to dig under, and too heavy to push over. But as soon as we realize what it is blocking us from which is our true consciousness then we know that the wall is not our true consciousness and then we no longer identify with it and then we realize it was our identifying that gave it substance as if to be a part of reality and therefore it disappears from our reality and the wall is no longer there. \\n',\n",

She believes things of other people and projects these beliefs onto them as if these distortions are happening to her and so she responds accordingly. She also both has an extreme way of expressing that she doesn’t want attention and an extreme way of saying she does. She must have gotten a lot of attention forced on her and learned that she needed to be extreme in her behavior to create the space she needed to relax. But then as a result she didn’t get any attention and so to get attention she had to learn to express needs for attention also in an extreme way. I know this because she has trained me to require more expression from her before I feel safe giving her attention. She does this to perfectly curate her experience in the world because she no longer trusts humans to curate it for her. This is especially telling because cats would rather not spend the energy to do anything in their environment so the fact that she feels the need to spend that much energy controlling her environment is a sign of perceived abuse that did not allow her to be a kitty who conserves energy. Poor thing. The only way I can think of to help her is to start demonstrating to her that if she lets you control her environment she will be happier than doing it herself. So far this means feeding her better food directly from you handed to her, and playing with her with toys she likes and introducing new toys and new ways of playing. There may be other clear ways to do this as well like supervised outside time in a very safe space. \\n',\n",

       " 'The escape velocity of a 4D surface is infinite 3D mass. Increasing 3D mass is the equivalent of 4D velocity. Increasing 3D mass through increasing 3D velocity is the equivalent of attaining a reference frame of 4D cohesive space. On earths surface, gravity impacts us such that we are in a non-uniform 3D cohesive space meaning that our reality is more similar to 2D cohesive space. To attain a more uniform 3D cohesive reference frame we have to travel away from earth’s gravity; and to live stationary in that uniform 3D cohesion we need to escape earth’s gravity. One can think of traveling away from earths surface as increasing the proportion of resistance of an object to its movement toward being its mass and not gravity. So while we aren’t increasing the 3D mass, we are increasing the proportion of mass to gravity. But 3D mass is itself a fusing of 4D gravity and 4D mass and to escape 4D gravity which is time we have to increase the proportion of 4D mass relative to 4D gravity. So once we’ve isolated 3D mass from 3D gravity, we now have to remove 4D gravity from 3D mass to achieve a spatially cohesive reference that allows us to experience or become 4D mass. When we increase our 3D velocity we are increasing 3D mass by decreasing 4D gravity which is the pull of time. This is similar to how when we are escaping earths gravity we are reducing 3D gravity. Note: achieving 3D spatial cohesion is about the direction component of velocity not the speed component, meaning you must achieve an ever increasing relative position from earth to continually decrease earths pull of gravity. But to escape 4D gravity, the component that matters isn’t the direction of velocity but rather the speed. The speed of light is the “direction” that one must fly to move away from the 4D surface of the 3D cohesive reference frame. This is because you want to decrease the component of 4D gravity but not the component of 4D mass. When you increase your speed you are decreasing the pull of Time which is 4D gravity in a 3D cohesive reference frame so speed isolates 4D mass from 4D gravity and this implies that one’s 3D mass goes to zero inside their own reference frame as it is removing the component that is creating 3D cohesive mass. This is similar to how you are decreasing the weight of yourself as you travel away from the earths surface, you are not increasing your 3D mass. Since mass and energy are the same this means that 3D energy is just 4D gravity collapsing 4D energy into 3D energy. Time being gravity means that time itself is a source of energy of matter. If time is flowing faster for a piece of matter than another piece of the same matter then the first piece of matter has more energy, more time momentum. When you reduce the energy that Time is imparting on a particle through speed then this balanced the increase of energy through that speed. From the reference frame of the person traveling they do not have any more energy that when they were at rest because while their speed has increased so has their time slowed down and so less energy as it is actually not moving at all because the slow down of time balances speed in terms of energy in that persons reference frame. This is why light always travels at light speed, because Time can no longer slow it down. It’s out of times grasp. If this were not true it would be impossible to have light with the properties it has. Light isn’t massless, it’s mass is 4D mass. \\n',\n",

Just remember to never emotionally identify with the emotional environments he is trying to create around himself because they are totally fake. Narcissists are trying to create a false identity by using power to curate emotional environments that give off a reflection of themselves that numbs or counterbalances the pain emanating from their true wounded identity. If you also choose to view your own reflection off the same environment then you are are at risk of emotional damage but if you exist in this environment without ever looking into its mirrors then you can safely exist in them emotionally. So keep that concept in mind! You’re less likely to lose your job if you’re able to avoid looking at yourself in the emotional mirrors created inside his environments (mirrors are when an experience in his environment leads you to question your place in reality). If you’re busy looking at yourself in mirrors, especially false ones, then you aren’t paying attention to the dangers around you. The more you are paying attention to the dangers around you and not looking at yourself in every mirror that you pass by the more effectively you will safely navigate his environments and therefore be able to keep your job. In a narcissists world, you need to become a sociopath. A sociopath is defined as someone who can’t see their own reflection in someone else’s emotional environments. A narcissist is someone who wears a blindfold in all others emotional environments so that they can not only avoid seeing the reflection they generate in other peoples emotional environments but also so that they don’t even notice that they are in anyone else’s emotional environments but their own. Sociopaths are the blind in other people’s emotional environments except for their own, but like blind people use other means to navigate the world they don’t know they are in, sociopaths learn to navigate emotional environments they know they are in but can’t see. \\n',\n",
       " 'Light travels at light speed in all reference frames because its 4D mass has escaped the pull of 4D gravity and so it has a uniform 4D cohesive reference frame which means that it is experienced the same in all 3D cohesive reference frames. This is also why Time is the same speed in all 3D cohesive reference frames because the effect of what we call Time is really 4D gravity which is a 4D cohesive force and so must be experienced the same in all reference frames and is also why we will always think we and all people from a 3D cohesive reference frame are experiencing forward movement of time because it must be experienced the same in all reference frames. Light is experienced the same in all reference frames because it’s 4D mass plus it is experienced from the perspective of an outside 3D reference frames the same as well when you correct for the effect of 3D gravity on its path. Time is experienced the same in all 3D reference frames because it’s 4D gravity (4Dness makes it so that things are experienced the same inside of a 3D reference frame) but it is experienced different from the perspective of an outside 3D reference frame so that I would observe Time moving slower or faster if someone has a different velocity or gravity acting on it than I do: this is due to gravity make the Time space dimension more non-uniformly cohesive with 3D space as if to squeeze it to the point that it nearly has 0 height. This is because 4D mass is 4D cohesive matter and therefore a product of 5D gravity which collapses the 5D cohesive dimension which would cause a reference frame property exactly the same as the reference frame properties of Time in our 3D perspective; and so 4D matter obeys the physics of 4D cohesive space because that’s closer to the true size of reality whereas a 3D cohesive reference frame has more illusion in it and so we are forced to observe it obeying the laws of higher dimensional physics and creating a paradox in ours ie having no 3D mass and traveling the same speed in all reference frames after correcting for 3D mass/gravity. This also implies that mass and gravity are the same within a given cohesive reference frame. Time as we understand it does not have the same 3D reference frame properties of light because the experience of Time is coming through 3D cohesive matter. We experience 4D gravity only through its fusion with 4D matter to create 3D mass. In other words, 4D gravity is converted to a 3D cohesive force through 3D mass and then it is observed by a 3D reference frame, whereas light is 4D mass experienced from a 3D reference frame; it is not converted to a 3D cohesive force or particle and therefore doesn’t have 3D mass or 3D gravity. Time is the way in which our 3D reference frame makes sense of matter having mass. An object without 3D mass does not and cannot experience Time because it is therefore not under the force of 4D gravity. As soon as 4D gravity is acting on an object it automatically has 3D mass BUT only from the perspective of a 3D reference frame, otherwise it has 4D weight. Our experience of 3D mass is actually 4D weight. The reason why we have massive objects in our 3D universe implies that there is 4D matter that is experiencing a massive amount of 4D gravity. It might be that 3D quanta is actually 4D mass that is under only a very small amount of 4D gravity and so has very little mass and that there is a limit of detection such that a 4D gravity force that is below a certain level acting on 4D matter has 3D mass but is impossible to detect. This could be the source of 3D dark energy or matter where 3D matter/mass is present but we can’t see it because it’s 4D matter that is undergoing only a tiny amount of 4D gravity and it might be that most of 4D matter is experiencing only a small amount of 4D gravity OR the 4D matter itself has such small 4D mass that very little 3D mass is created; 3D matter than we can see might actually be the minority. Kind of like amount of 3D matter that feels Earth’s gravitational pull up to a level X, X finite, is a tiny proportion of all 3D matter. So it would stand to reason that there is more dark energy and dark matter in terms of 3D mass compared to the mass of the visible 3D universe. This would also imply that if 4D gravity increases or decreases or fluctuates then so does the 3D mass of an object but it would be undetectable unless the change was drastic and sudden. This might explain why quanta pop seemingly in and out of existence as 4D gravity fluctuates based on movements occurring in the 4D universe creating changes in 4D gravity. So even we are in flux in terms of our 3D mass. The expansion of the universe may be a result of 4D gravity coming from the object that is the center of our 3D universe (our 4D Sun or 4D blackhole) traveling through 4D universe and as it reaches new 4D matter. Let’s assume 4D gravity (and therefore 4D light) travels at c, then why is our 3D universe expanding at faster than the speed of light and accelerating? Well, 3D velocity is 4D position and 3D acceleration is 4D velocity ie no acceleration, so 4D gravity is going at a constant velocity with speed equal to the speed of light, c, and in all directions of 4D. If the travel of 4D gravity through the 4D universe is converting new 4D matter to 3D mass which at this point is mostly 3D dark energy or dark matter or dark mass AND since velocity means constant rate of change in position and a change in 4D position is experienced from a 3D reference frame as 3D acceleration then the expansion of 3D universe would look to always be increasing in speed. Further our 3D universe is expanding everywhere because the 4D radius of the reach of 4D gravity is increasing and our 3D universe is the edge of this gravity and this creates both an expansion in our 3D view of reality as well as expansion of what we call Time and this is why we see Time going in the forward direction because the radius of 4D gravity is increasing. In other words, our 3D spatial reality is the surface or edge of the traveling of 4D gravity, and our experience of Time moving forward is the increase in the radius that this 4D gravity has traveled. The expansion of the surface of the reach of 4D gravity, presumably emanating from some 4D object, is creating separation between the points on its surface and so we interpret that as space being added to our 3D universe. In other words, 3D expansion is the increase in the surface area of the reach of 4D gravity (4D gravity from the 3D reference frame might be 4D light fyi), and 3D Time is the distance or radius it has traveled. As this 4D gravity extends it encompasses the gravity field of other 4D objects and the interaction of opposing 4D gravity fields creates a disturbance in the surface of our 4D gravity field and this disturbance creates ripples in the surface of our 4D gravity which creates 3D mass that is separate from the uniform flatness of the undisturbed 4D gravity surface. Does this imply that 3D mass is everywhere and that gravity is the extension of mass or does this suggest that the original impact creates a crater on the surface of 4D and the ripples from the impact are 3D gravity flowing outward at the speed of c. This also implies that for every object emanating 4D gravity, there is a universe. So when a 4D gravity field interacts with ours, we are interacting with it and so we create ripples or waves or mass in their universe but we don’t collide and destroy each other because forces don’t destroy each other but rather react; they don’t impact, they react, they balance, they respond. So as the energy dissipates on the surface of our 4D gravity, this translates into decay of 3D matter. The forward movement of Time that we perceive is therefore the dissipation of energy from reactions on our 4D surface to other gravitational fields, ie it is the return to a no energy state or a flat surface of 4D gravity. Since an impact would cause a dent in the surface and if Time is the distance from the center of the 4D object that created the 4D gravity then being in or on the dent means that you are slightly closer to the center than the non-impacted part of the surface. But Time is still flowing forward so you aren’t going back in Time and your rate of change of position is the same so you don’t notice that you are slightly behind. Black holes are impacts that decelerate the movement of a position on the surface of the 4D gravity but not to 0. If this 4D gravity is emanating from a 4D object in all directions equally then the shape of the universe is spherical in space-time and it is finite since the 4D surface area is finite. The reason why the rate of expansion is allowed to go faster than the speed of light from our reference frame is that the effect is coming from a higher dimensional spatial reference frame or cohesion and therefore is more close to real reality and so that 4D reference frame, ie its physics, trumps the physics of our 3D reference frame and so any paradox it creates from our perspective is a result of the flaw or estimation properties of our inferior 3D reference frame. The paradox is that in a 4D reference frame the speed limit of reality of c is being obeyed but in our 3D reference frame it is not, and this is ok that the speed limit is not being obeyed in our 3D universe or reference frame because we can blame it on the error created from trying to view a 4D phenomena from a 3D reference frame and if we correct for this then we find that the speed limit of reality is actually being obeyed. This implies that our 3D universe will never collapse in on itself and will just continue to accelerate forever provided the 4D universe is also expanding (which it is) but at some point this means it will not be able to reach new 4D matter and so our 3D universe will not add more 3D dark energy or matter. The reason why 3D gravity obeys our reference frame speed limit is because it is 3D gravity, not a 4D phenomena being viewed from 3D. This would suggest that 3D light, because it isn’t accelerating, is stationary relative to 4D gravity meaning that it would have to be 4D matter that is out of reach of 4D gravity due to the expansion of the 4D universe, ie 3D light is 4D matter that is outside of the observable 4D universe relative the the 4D object whose 4D gravity defines the center of our 3D universe. So the escape velocity of our 3D universe, observable or not, that removes the perception of Time and takes us out of the 4D gravitational pull of our 3D universe, that takes us off the surface of the 4D object, the surface being our 3D universe, that increases the uniformity of the 4th dimension of our reference frame that we think is 3D so that the 4th dimension becomes perceivable in its true form with is spatially cohesive with 3D space, is light speed c. But this is probably impossible because 3D acceleration is 4D velocity, and since we are already in the 4D gravity field that we are trying to escape we would have to reach a velocity faster than c in the 4D universe and that’s impossible. But all this means is that we can’t escape our observable universe defined by the bounds of the speed limit. That said, escape velocity is about orbiting earth not about escaping its gravity fully. Maybe 3D light is 4D matter that is orbiting our 3D universe and therefore living in 4D space, ie the space that all 4D objects exist, just like 3D space where the Earth sits with all other stars and planets. So the 4D escape velocity that creates a perspective of 4D cohesive space might be less than c. This also implies a new theory that our measurement of dark energy and dark matter should be increasing unless there isn’t an illusion of reality that hides this fact, for instance, maybe the addition of new 3D dark energy, matter, mass or any mass for that matter is offset or looks to us as if the universe is expanding but I haven’t thought this through yet. Because 4D gravity is always moving outward and we are the surface, time travel into the past and future is impossible and doesn’t even make sense. Our consciousnesses and matter are just changes in the shape of the surface of 4D gravity and since Time is the distance of the surface from its original center it doesn’t make sense to ask about time travel. Going into the past or future would require one to cut themself off as a piece of the surface of 4D gravity and to go into the past you would have to push at the very least a local part of the surface backward and reverse the direction of the flow of 4D gravity which could only be done using a 4D object somehow, and to travel in the future you would have to extend your surface further than it is and it’s already traveling at c so there’s no way to do this. This also means the universe is deterministic in terms of the shapes created on the 4D surface as these come from other gravitation fields already in existence and so though we don’t know their impact, their impact is already determined and predictable if you had more information. In this way it is possible to calculate the future just like we can calculate the path of objects in space, and for the same reason we can recalculate the past. So both the past and future are calculable and can be written down and therefore saved and stored as memory. Nothing is lost. Evolution is the force of how the ripples on this 4D surface coalesce on very small scales. Our 3D universe might actually be the result of a SINGLE impact of the surface of a 4D gravity with another 4D gravity field. And this created a sort of crater with a center 4D space which we call the beginning of Time and the spatial dimension is arbitrary but can be in relation to other craters like we do with galaxies; and there are other craters on the surface representing other 3D universes. This implies that full reality has been around much longer than our universe and we don’t even know how far the 4D gravity surface has been traveling in 4D space. So the energy emanating from the impact that created our 3D universe is actually the distortion it is creating through the 4D surface at the same time that the surface is expanding and so the crater is expanding. If you zoom into this crater you can see that the distortions are not smooth, meaning that there are craters inside the crater, and craters inside those craters, and craters inside those craters, and so on and so forth on a scale that is massive. It’s like how guitar hero works, or a self-playing piano, or the inversion of brail, or how a light impacts photo paper. It’s like a 4D uniform, smooth, flat force emanated and then there was a single, separate massive 4D gravitation field that created a giant crater in our 4D field’s surface and ours continued in 4D space, the crater also expanded in size as the surface area of our 4D gravity stretched and increased; and there are tiny and large 4D gravity fields or slightly unsmooth parts of the same gravitational field aligned with the crater such that our surface is impacted by these parts and creates little indents or shapes on the surface of our 4D field that we call 3D mass and includes us and our consciousnesses (though not our awarenesses) and so at the right time these shapes are moving across the surface of the crater according to the interaction with the shapes of another 4D field which looks to us like moving through 3D space; and even our movements and choices are just the predictable 4D physics of our 4D field impacting another and the flow of the energy across this surface so that everything is deterministic. Even our death can be the impact of a part of another 4D field on our surface that wipes out the shape on the surface that defines our consciousness such that it can’t be held together and redistributes this energy in a potentially violent way (like grief) depending on the object and how it impacted. Or the indent that defines our consciousness just returns to uniform flatness as the energy that created our consciousness dissipates and decays over time and due to the expansion. If there was no expansion of the surface then we would just travel around and live forever until something impacts us since energy doesn’t dissipate until a force impacts it. Expansion is the equivalent of 3D energy traveling through space and therefore dissipating. The expansion of the 4D surface causes the energy to be spread across more area and therefore it dissipates and flattens out and so we die. The more gravity (even emotional gravity) that is real, from true ego, the longer one will live if one’s energy is not broken apart by impacting some other 4D gravity field. Awareness is how we choose to see reality. For example, it’s false ego to see the sun as a circle and the earth as the center of the universe. It’s true ego to see the earth as orbiting the sun and spherical. False ego is like choosing to perceive the world within a smaller dimension than is real and then interpreting the rest as one wishes. For example, we see the skin of every human but I can make up anything I want for what lies underneath that skin like I can say oh that person coughed so they have viral matter inside their skin which may not be true at all. Or they can perceive the covid vaccine as causing harm to the inside of their body or can believe they are feeling pain etc. Awareness is how much or how little we choose to see the properties of the shapes of the 4D surface, and what we see that is accurate is True Ego and what we don’t choose to see or can’t see but know is there implies that we make something up to describe it and that is false ego. This suggest there are two kinds of multiverses: 1) the multiverse that has its existence as a shape on the same 4D surface as we do; ie other craters on the same surface. 2) A universe that is a crater on a separate surface of another 4D gravitation field than our own. These are fields that we are potentially impacting to create our reality. So our future may be another universes past but we don’t live their reality in reverse; the shapes on our surface are complimentary to their shapes but the interpretation of those shapes and properties of those shapes relative to all other shapes on our surface is different kind of like how DNA is complimentary but the nucleotides are NOT inverses of each other in the chemical sense, just in the label sense, and it also matters that DNA is ready in the opposite direction of the opposite strand, and so the impact of a complimentary part of a strand doesn’t produce the same of complimentary or opposite protein or effect. Likewise, though our future is the result of another universes past and is complimentary in that it is predictable what shape our surface will take, the way in which those shapes play out or are expressed in our reality is different from the way the other universes past played out; AND this is important because this resolves the paradox of cause and effect. If our future played out another universes past then our experience of events would create a paradox because cause and effect would not be preserved in both reference frames and 4D physics would not be consistent across separate 4D gravitational fields which would be a violation of a 4D reference frame. It’s kind of like how it would be ridiculous to think that the complimentary strand of DNA would produce the opposite protein and have the opposite effect of the other strand’s protein, thereby undoing its effects; life could not exist this way. ACA codes for a different amino acid than TGT and so they produce wildly different proteins that likely do not have opposite effects. Similarly, another universe’s past does not create a future for us that is the opposite of their sequence of cause and effect. Their cause and effect produces a sequence of cause and effect that is nothing like their cause and effect forward or in reverse. If our future were effect and cause we would reinterpret what the effect means in relation to our direction of reality and this would change the nature of the cause that follows the effect such that the effect that results in our universe does not create a paradox of effect preceding cause and so we maintain that we are moving forward in Time despite being impacted in the direction of another universe’s past. Their effect creates a complimentary shape in our universe, but the shape is first interpreted in relation to not only the rest of the shapes in our universe but also the direction in which our universe is outwardly flowing (which may not be directly in another universe past if the fields are not perfectly opposing) which changes the expectation of how those shapes are going to change; and only then do we perceive what we call a “cause” (which is the same thing as awareness: “cause” is the awareness of the shape in one’s reality reference frame). Once we have a cause then the effects that are possible are only those that obey our expectation of how our universe shapes can evolve and so we will never perceive an effect that would make it look like it was the cause, ie we will never see reality play out in a way that is in reverse or defies the physics of our universe AND both universes (separate 4D surfaces) live in the same 4D space and so both obey the same physics so if to us it’s a paradox that a person grows from being old to being young then it’s also a paradox in their universe and so it is impossible for any event in either universe to create a situation where effect would precede the cause IF you are perceiving the events in the direction of the actual flow of their 4D surface ie you are obeying the forward direction of 4D Time which both share. So there is no such thing as a universe that we would ever observe going backward in Time relative to us. We are both going forward in Time and it is impossible for us to be in their universe while keeping our orientation of expansion of our universe and if we did we would cease to exist because their universe would pass us right by and we would only be in it for a split second as it moved through us. If we are viewing another universe then we must be a shape in that universe. This also means that it is possible for our shape which is our existence defined as physical + time + consciousness but we would have different awareness of self because this would effect how well we can measure the location and form of our shape through pinging off other shapes that can reflect back (the flatness of the 4D surface can’t reflect back so we have to reflect of shapes) and these shapes can be different in different universes leading to a different weighting of consciousness to create awareness, as well as a different identity (a different set of dimensions of consciousness that are being measured). What does it mean that light is traveling outside of Time then? Light is from our perspective traveling across the 4D surface and so though it is traveling at the same speed it follows the curvature of the surface in order to stay visible in our present reality otherwise it would be in a location that represents our past or our future. This also suggests that light is attached to the surface but what does it mean to not have mass and not be affected by time? To not have mass means that it is not creating an indent or shape in the surface and this might be the result of something moving on the surface but that isn’t the surface itself (ie not emanating 4D surface shapes) moving at the same speed as the 4D surface velocity which is the speed of light, c. Maybe shapes don’t move across the surface but rather are impacted by waves of energy flowing over them and changing how other people reflect off of the shape and vice versa so it only appears like we are moving in 3D space but really we have waves of energy that make it look like we have moved but rather our shape is being squeezed and expanding making it look like we are moving. Then light is actual movement of these waves. Or our movement in 3D creates changes to the direction of light energy or of other objects that redirect energy and this changes the flow of energy waves across the surface. So a flat 4D gravity field is 3D darkness and a shape is able to create energy waves that we can see as light if the right frequency, and more in general that we experience as radiation. So mass is the warping of the surface, the shape is the matter we perceive, and the ripples of energy it creates is light or radiation when it reaches the shape we define as ourselves ie the wave that washes over us. When we see the wave it assumes a shape relative to the surrounding surface that we perceive as flat relative to it or separated and based on the orientation that we are perceiving it but when we don’t perceive it then it is existing in a wave that can be perceived from various orientations and so it holds all shapes and doesn’t become a shape until one pings it from the perspective of their own reference frame. Meaning that waves of energy or quanta possess a unique shape in all 3D reference frames (brains) and when a reference frame perceives it, it has a shape specific to that reference frame and that act of perceiving is the same as we do to create awareness which is to ping our surface shape (our reference frame or orientation to realtiy) off the surface which sends back a signal that we then interpret as a 3D shape because our reference frame is 3D cohesive space. This means that if anyone else were to measure it from another reference frame it would take a slightly different shape but a wave can only be pinged from one location at a time because the state of the wave is easy to disrupt and so another ping would measure a slightly different shape. One way of measuring this would be to ping something that is symmetrical in 3D space from the other side at the exact same time but then one would get the same shape. It’s possible therefore to ping a particle and for the resulting shape to change such that a second measurement returns a different shape that corresponds to a different particle. The types of particles are determined by shape and mass and orientation. If you want to find a new particle of an old wave you need to find an orientation that produces a new shape and have the resolution of its surrounding environment to be smaller. It’s like a mountain will look like a mountain until you get closer and then you see a tree, then a rock, then a mountain. What makes a shape a shape is not only the precision of where you ping but the contrast you can create relative to its surroundings so the closer you understand its surroundings the more shapes you can pick up and therefore more particles but obviously there’s a limit because what you’re pinging with is energy which needs to be a small shape relative to the shape you are measuring. It’s like trying to take a picture with a few pixels. The pixels have to get smaller to get detail through contrasting with the surrounding environment. So back to light, light is waves but with 0 mass. This to me is a result of a particle that has the same shape in all reference frames meaning unlike quanta, light is a perfectly shared reality such that from no matter what orientation you measure it you get the same shape back and so we experience light in its wave form and not a particle form because it’s true nature is a wave and so it stays that way. This means that it isn’t a particle that has mass or matter but is pure energy. Matter with mass is energy or a wave that does not create a shared reality despite existing as a wave meaning that it takes on different shapes based on the orientation of the 3D reference frame that is observing it and so it has to take a matter form with mass if that’s the case to resolve the paradox that it can take on different shapes while also being a wave like light (what about multiverse and schrodingers cat). So light is the same as all other waves that produce all matter but it is a wave with a specific orientation to 3D cohesive space such that no matter what angle you look at it, no matter the 3D reference frame, it takes on the same shape and so it is allowed to exist as a shared reality and therefore not take a shape to solve the paradox of it being a wave with different shapes. This orientation is such that it is perfectly parallel with the flow of 4D gravity, extending normal to the 4D surface in the direction of forward Time such that it is perfectly symmetrical like a 3D bell shape curve of space-time, and the symmetry of the shape means that we interpret it as pure energy and not matter. It’s the asymmetry of the shape of energy from a 3D reference frame that we interpret as matter or mass. Light is therefore negative mass whereas blackholes are massive positive mass ie darkness or non-light. Maybe light is actually lightholes ie lots of negative mass extending the surface in the forward time direction. This means if we were to be on the other side of the surface like the upside-down world of Stranger Things we would observe black holes as light and light as black holes (?). Let me slightly change the definition of light because light appear to have no mass. This shape of wave that produces light is a perfectly symmetrical hill of space-time whereas a blackhole is a perfectly symmetrical pit but what we call light isn’t the shape of the hill because anything with mass creates an indent not a hill and so we are unable to ping a hill because the space between us and the hill in the direction of 4D space that would allow us to ping its shape and see that it is a hill is our future, ie our surface hasn’t reached the area of space that we are expanding into and so we can’t send anything in 3D to see it without being able to break through the fabric of 3D reality ie create a wormhole that connects us to the hill. So what we call light isn’t the shape of the wave or else we would be able to observe a particle that has negative mass (this also means that we can’t ever find a particle with negative mass without producing a wormhole if even that would do it); instead light is seen only when the bottom of the hill reaches our position. This means light propagation is equivalent to the way we feel 3D gravity: the surface of it travels at c and then reaches us and then we are in it. The bottom of the bell shape curve of the hill reaches us like gravity and then we are in the gravity. So basically, light is the gravity of 3D negative mass; light is negative gravity but since we have positive mass it doesn’t affect us as if gravity. Light is the accretion disk of an inverted negative mass blackhole which is really a lighthole, or it is our perception of the 3D surface of the negative gravity induced by 3D negative mass. This means that what we call gravity coming from positive mass is seen as light by the universe that is on the upside-down 4D surface ie the universe where forward time is directed toward the past. This means that it is possible for there to be negative mass stars that collapse into negative mass blackholes that we experience only the accretion disk of that we call light as the accretion disk reaches us. So light has no mass because we can only experience the 0-mass component of negative matter which is its negative gravity. Gravity doesn’t have mass. So light and gravity are exactly the same thing but seen inside-out. Gravity we see as adding positive mass and so it looks like we are being dragged into a pit and light we see gravity that doesn’t add mass and so we experience it as if it is doing nothing as we are unaware of the negative mass effect. Adding negative mass doesn’t subtract from our positive mass, it just changes our 3D reference frame to be the same exact positive mass just oriented in the direction of negative mass so that negative matter always looks to us as 0 mass, ie we measure our positive mass from the reference frame we are in and if we are climbing the hill which is a reference frame with negative mass added then we measure ourself off the surface of this negative mass and get the same amount of positive mass. If we are in complete darkness we get the same positive mass calculation because we are now measuring our mass relative to 0 mass. Our 3D mass is the different in mass in the positive direction relative to the mass of our local area. This is just like our mass doesn’t change no matter what gravity field we are in because our mass is measured relative to the gravitational field. But it does increase our weight because gravity from positive mass multiplies with our positive mass to produce positive weight but negative gravity from negative mass multiplying with our positive mass does not make sense because from our reference frame the force would be coming from our future which is impossible. This doesn’t really make sense but I like the idea of it. I think it’s really because you can’t subtract weight via negative gravity for some reason or else we would flip over to the other side of the surface reality. Light doesn’t experience Time because it isn’t a shape of the surface, and this is the same reason why gravity doesn’t experience negative Time; neither light nor gravity are 3D objects and so have no mass; rather they are opposite (or complimentary) interpretations of the warping of the space-time surface: gravity in the direction of the past that slows down positive time for positive mass objects and light in the direction that slows down time for negative mass objects. In other words, gravity is the interpretation of how positive mass objects change our 3D reference frame, and light is the interpretation of how negative mass objects change our 3D reference frame. My fear of opening up to a physicist is like being a lottery ticket where you know the chances of you winning are next to zero so you hand the 7-11 clerk your ticket to check if you won seeing no risk in doing so because it’s probably not a winning ticket but then it is and the 7-11 clerk lies and keeps it for themself; the chances that any of my theories are remotely true are about the same as winning the lottery but I also don’t trust the 7-11 clerk to tell me I won if I did because of the implications for themself if they lie. Quantum reality: could shapes be created that extend into our future? Yes, negative mass the gravity of which we experience as light. Could something be orbiting our universe or could we escape the surface? No because matter is the inside shape of a shape of the surface. We aren’t the surface itself but rather the unique shape of the indent, the distance of all sides of the indent from all other sides. You can’t escape the surface without taking the surface with you. It’s like asking can the inside shape of the a cup escape the inside surface of the cup? No because the inside shape doesn’t exist without the inside surface. Light existing implying that negative mass exists also implies that there is a universe on the flip side of the 4D surface although this does not sound cohesive with the direction of flow and impacting other gravitational fields except that there could be gravitation fields behind us that then impact from underneath our surface and therefore create negative mass objects. Correction: our 3D reality (given how I’ve described gravity and light shapes) might be the flip side of the expanding 4D gravity surface and what defines matter is the outside surface shape of waves directed inward and we are able to see other positive mass matter because we can ping off each other’s shape but we can’t see negative mass because its shape lies on the other side of the surface, on the other side of reality, the other side of the sheet of paper. From a fixed side of the 4D gravity surface, light is the experiencing of the inner surface of a curvature of space-time, and gravity or mass or matter is the experiencing of the outer surface of a curvature of space-time. With light there is nothing to ping off of to get the shape so it has 0 mass. With positive matter there is a shape to ping off off like how you can see a hill if you’re on top of a hill but you can’t see inside a pit. This means that we can never go the speed of light because that would require inverting the orientation of our shape to have negative mass. Going the speed of light requires turning a positive mass object into a negative mass object. \\n',\n",

The illusion we see actually has 0 mass because it’s an illusion: the face isn’t actually protruding but because it looks like it’s protruding then we are able to see it in our universe but it has no gravity. But it’s protruding on the other side and so has mass on the other side of the universe and so because it has true positive mass in that universe and the symmetry of full reality is that mass isn’t real (everything is a wave) then it is equal to negative mass in our reality but not experienced as mass but rather light or radiation or EM field.

       " 'Depression occurs when you are pinging yourself off of an illusion of reality (like career, society, money, etc) and not getting a signal back and so you feel lost. If you don’t identify with that dimension of false reality as being part of your true consciousness then even if that dimension is such that it won’t return a signal back for you it doesn’t matter because you aren’t sending a signal in the first place. Consciousness is what provides emotional safety, the more dimensions or angles of your consciousness you are pinging and the stronger the signal that you get back is the more connected you are to your consciousness and the more aware of the finer details of its shape: the is emotional safety. Emotional safety is achieved when it is the equivalent of chemical safety ie full connection to consciousness. Identity safety is psychological safety because this is the perceived dimension or angles consciousness; the directions you are sending signals. If your perception of consciousness is perfectly aligned with your true consciousness then psychological/identity safety are equivalent to emotional safety and if in addition pings off their full range of consciousness then these are all the same as chemical safety. Emotional safety is achieved by strengthening whatever signals are being pinged off of one’s true consciousness. Identity safety is achieved by strengthening the signals of one’s perceived consciousness whether those perceptions are true or false. Chemical safety is achieved by the increase of signals of one’s true consciousness, the increase in density of the signals pinged off of one’s true consciousness, especially if it leads to more breadth. Psychological safety is the equivalent of chemical safety except it’s the increase of the number of signals coming off of one’s identity which again can contain both the true consciousness and false consciousness. Depression for me right now is caused by a loss of identity safety meaning that certain signals are becoming weak as if I’m floating away from my identity and eventually when I can no longer pick up those signals it causes a drop in psychological safety if I’m continuing to try to ping off of them and getting nothing back. The question is whether or not these signals are coming from my true consciousness or not. If not, then if I can learn to not try to ping off of them and instead redirect the energy I am saving by not pinging then toward increasing my emotional safety through strengthening or searching for new directions to ping (say within career regardless of money) that increase emotional safety and chemical safety, respectively, (ie pinging off my consciousness) then I will increase my identity safety and will counterbalance this depression caused by a drop in identity safety and ultimately psychological safety which leads to suffering and potentially suicide. It’s not that career isn’t part of my consciousness, it’s that the angle in which I’m pinging toward the career direction is off and not hitting any surface of my true consciousness and the false ego wall of career has moved its position and so I’m getting no signal back. For instance, I could be pinging at an angle that is partially motivated or weighted by fears around money or status or failure. This is like throwing a dart  at a board and someone (belief of money as identity, or needs of status, or fears) bumps you a little and changes your angle as you throw and the dart hits the wall behind instead of the board. If the wall suddenly disappeared or got further away (but the dart board stayed in the same location) then the dart would hit the floor and not send a signal back which represented by the dart point landing into something, or the dart would eventually reach the wall and would hit it with less force and the signal would be weaker—this is a drop in identity safety (hitting wall with weaker force), and a drop in psychological safety (the dart never penetrates anything and lands on the floor). So I need to adjust my aim to correct for the impact of money or whatever so that I hit the dart board and eventually the correction is done second nature and I perceive myself to be aiming directly at the board as if there is no impact of money. So it’s not that I need to find a way to live without career. The wall has dropped further back almost to the point of me not being able to hit the wall with the dart and I need to figure out how to still throw the dart but adjust my aim to hit the board until I am able to hit the bulls eye and then career will be solved. I learned to offset the bias in my aim in the emotional direction of consciousness caused by trauma when all of a sudden my darts were hitting the floor and I was at risk of committing suicide and extreme suffering. My aim finally shifted to finally hit the outside of the board and though this is low scoring, it only took a couple years of small adjustments to my aim and then I was able to hit the bulls eye despite participating in the emotional world. I did the same for my sexual direction of consciousness. Though, my aim is off a little now because of the loss of career and home, and having a new relationship, and the damage done by getting sick with covid for 3 weeks. A new relationship I can handle on its own but I am handling 3 or 4 forces at once all fucking up my original aim and it’s hard to offset this many new forces so my precision is wildly off. \\n',\n",
       " 'Cant believe you almost didn’t go. Don’t forget that concept in general! I was getting worried about whether you were forgetting the parts of you that are truly unique and bring out your color. You need to join the new with the old, like consistently adding furniture from the storage to your new home and new furniture. The act of making them cohesive in the same living space (ie decoration) transforms the old into feeling like new and accents the new through the old to feel like they’ve been with you just as long: emotional cohesion. This is a general concept of not only emotional decoration of one’s emotional home but also of one’s physical home and physical reality and doing drugs as well. A home that is filled with a bunch of new stuff is going to feel flat, no depth, as if you took the flatness of the experience of the empty home and just added physical dimension but not emotional dimension and so the emotional experience remains flat. A home that is filled with just old stuff is going to feel flat in a different way; the energy that the old generates has dissipated just like energy dissipates over time and the emotional experience flattens out like acclimating over time to the effect of a drug. To keep things fresh, instead of new or old, one must introduce new into the old and old into the new and the way you feel their combination will be fresh because you navigated your way meticulously to their integration following your own experience toward an optimal integration called cohesion. The level of detail and color and variety and resolution of this physical and emotional cohesive space is increased if you have an optimal distribution (probably bell shaped, maybe a bit chi-squared) of old to new and with higher density. You left parts of your “old” self in storage—you lost or had to give up part of the structures of say family and community that when present allow you to express parts into reality, you lost the external emotional gravity that naturally surfaces true parts of you. Other structures remained present and active (like VC, our dynamic, and some of your family and friend dynamics) and you transformed those structures over the last couple years, like reupholstering old furniture, so that they surface healthier expression of self. And other structures were brand new like Taco Baby; the structure of emotional healing, growth and self awareness; your home leading to expressions of introvertedness; building a new community of friends. But you were saying things like “I’m not that excited to hang out with ‘those’ girls” or “Things are fine with Molly but I don’t want to hang out with her” or “They invited me but I just want to stay at home”, or “I’m not interested in Burning Man” or “I’m exhausted and just want to be at home” etc. All of that is fine as long as it isn’t actually indicative of you keeping the parts of yourself forced in storage locked in their as if a prisoner with a life sentence. I was also worried that adderall could be having this effect. I’ve told you before that Adderall is a SILENT KILLER—It gives you dopamine for free! This means that your brain no longer had a dopamine attachment or need for the dopamine that your brain gets from the natural emotional/dopamine producing structures that you have built and maintained in your reality for years with blood, sweat and tears, like family and friends and hobbies. Adderall is good for quitting addictions like smoking or drinking or sex etc. But it’s like an emotional antibiotic: it kills both good and bad sources of “bacteria” ie both good and bad structures of dopamine. I was worried that in addition to huge change in life leading to a distancing from the good structures in your reality, adderall was aiding in you not feeling or responding to the emotional/dopamine gravity that those structures are meant to have on you leading to a silent decay or death of those structures that you have built specifically to surface great parts of yourself that you found and developed over 34 years. \\n',\n",
       " 'When one pings off of walls and those walls move away it creates emotional gravity in negative mass sort of way where it becomes a dominant force is shaping your emotional reality and it distorts reality such that you no longer feel the gravity of other things just like we don’t feel the gravity of a table because the earths gravity is so much larger. The distortion probably follows the same relativity principles as physical distortions if emotions are part of true reality meaning that emotional light bends according to one’s local emotional gravity fields passing through and so it can bend the emotional light reflected of other people such that that light has to travel a farther distance to get to your eyes and so the signal is weaker. In other words, if you ping off something that isn’t your consciousness and the wall moves further and distorts its gravity to be stronger then signals in other directions are also weakened or unmeasurable leading to a collapse of reality as all forms of identity are falling away and disappearing and this can lead to suicide which is an emotional blackhole where one is no longer receiving any emotional light signals from reality and is therefore in darkness relative to all other emotional reference frames and is in darkness in their own since there is nothing to reflect off of anymore but the self. We have to expand our identity to include directions and angles that may not ping off our consciousness so that we can search for our consciousness in this general direction. The error comes when one gets a reflection back from the wall and acts as if that’s their consciousness and then no longer searches. Then emotional reality is such that it follows chaos theory and so the wall will naturally drift and sort of fall away and then it will send you in a crisis to find your anchor in that direction which can only be your consciousness and then it can become to late and you lose your balance and fall toward that direction like gravity is increasing in that direction leading to a collapse of one’s full identity. So it’s not wrong to ping off of walls as long as you aren’t pinging off walls indefinitely and are in a constant question-answer search for one’s own consciousness in the context of whatever that general direction represents (career, friends, family, education, emotional connections, sex, romance, hobbies, money, caregiving, physical health etc). Then the wall can fall away but you’re now anchored to your consciousness which is like land that doesn’t float or follow the currents of the ocean; and you’ve moved on to a new direction to search for consciousness and a new wall against which to search and create the contrast of and find one’s own consciousness. That language when consciousness is found can’t be lost ever and become part of the center of your emotional reference frame, your own emotional gravity. So if you collapse you take the language of your consciousness with you but not the actual consciousness ie the signals disappear. One’s identity is their connection to the rest of the world, to other peoples or a collective emotional reference frame in reality that has yet to reveal your own consciousness inside of it, ie where you are in relation to it. I am losing identity and collapsing fast and I may be anchored only to language, in other words my actual awareness is no longer alive because there’s no more signals and I’m just a language, an echo of an awareness waiting to dissipate into silence: suicide. \\n',\n",

       " 'The shape of the universe in my theory can’t be perfectly flat or else we wouldn’t have light, but it can be flat against the shape of the 4D surface, meaning that it’s concavity in 4D cohesive space can be the same as the convexity of the surface of the 4D gravitational field. So our universe is an inverted circular section of the surface of a 4D sphere kind of like a crater, and the expansion of the universe decreases the concavity over time until it goes back to convexity as if to stretch out a crater until it equals the curvature of the surrounding area. If we calculate the curvature of the universe against 3D Euclidean geometry ie from a Euclidean 3D cohesive reference frame then the universe will always come out as appearing flat. If you measure it against a non-Euclidean 3D cohesive reference frame then what is flat in 3D Euclidean is curved on 3D non-Euclidean. The reason we are in a non-Euclidean 3D reference frame is because our universe exists as the surface of a 4D sphere. The fact that measurements of the curvature of the universe come out as flat against a 3D Euclidean reference frame implies that in a non-Euclidean symmetric 3D reference frame the curvature of the universe is not flat but is symmetric. I write all of this just to document what I need to think about further. This is likely wrong in its conclusions but there’s a way to fix them to achieve the goal of suggesting a mathematically sound theory that the universe curvature would come out as flat even though it isn’t and it only is based on an assumption that isn’t true about full reality. \\n',\n",

Emotional incohesion is when one understands the all the emotional logic but subsets have differently oriented emotional reference frames or realities. Emotional cohesion is a shared reality of all logic. Seeing emotions is the ability to view emotional logic from within an emotional reality or reference frame. Feeling emotions is the response of the brain to the characteristics of their emotional environment at their given location. It’s the environment seeing you, not you seeing the environment, allowing you to also know what objects are in the environment but where they are.

So emotional sight is knowing where the sun is which allows me to easily know what direction to go to find shade. Emotional sight therefore implies a cohesive emotional reference frame.

Well, it’s the ability to view/translate/project all of one’s physical reality through a spatially (ie visual) cohesive emotional reference frame. A blind person has no visual reference frame so they are able to feel objects but can’t see them in a spatially cohesive reality. To have physical sight is to view one’s reality from a spatially cohesive physical reference frame. BUT, a blind person is able to walk around a room that they are familiar with and so they are able to construct a spatially cohesive physical reference frame without relying on light and eyesight. And remember that what we see is in our brain and so a physical reference frame created by light versus created by a blind person are the exact same except that it isn’t a shared reality ie it isn’t an externalized reference frame for them. A person with eyesight is merely able to see their reference frame externally as if they projected it out of their brain (even though they didn’t) simply because other people around them have verified and confirmed that it is a shared reference frame. It has been proven in psychology/neuroscience that if enough people deny the visual experience of a person, that person will deny their experience to the point of no longer seeing their experience. It’s similar to the way our brain doesn’t see our nose even though it’s there (selective vision) but if someone points out your nose it will all of a sudden appear in your vision. Confirmation of our reference frame brings awareness to it and awareness is the projection of a reference frame. My point is, that a blind person sees exactly like a non-blind person except that what the blind person sees isn’t confirmed and so they are not aware that they are visually seeing even though they are using their visual cortex (I didn’t look this up but I bet it’s been shown that blind people utilize their visual cortex). I just looked it up and YEP!! blind people heavily employ their visual cortex to process auditory and touch sensory information which being the visual cortex has the effect of creating a spatially cohesive reference frame to view their reality comprised of their sensory information. This means I have repurposed my visual cortex to process emotional input to create an emotional reference frame as a result of being emotionally blind and needing to see for purposes of physical survival. So blind people aren’t aware that they are seeing ie that they are using the same are of the brain, visual cortex, as non-blind people to know how to navigate a room. This means that I have emotional sight but it’s not in my awareness ie it’s something that I am conscious of, that I have emotional sight, but not able to experience as sight just like a blind person is conscious that they are seeing the room without being able to experience light and so are unaware that it is actual sight. I know I am able to emotionally see even though I am not aware of emotional light. You don’t have to receive physical light to see. You only need physical light to see in a particular way. Similarly, emotional light is not the only way to create a spatially cohesive emotional environment. But this puts more burden on the brain which is probably why society hasn’t developed emotional sight. In other words, when you build vision through light you don’t have to use memory to remember where things are: light will always answer your questions in real-time and super fast. This saves dopamine. It’s like storing all your iPhone photos in the cloud: when you need it you can receive it so you don’t need to store the information in the brain. Light is the cloud storage of spatially cohesive reality. In order for the blind person to build and maintain a spatially cohesive physical reference frame, they have to create their own light and therefore use their brain to store and retrieve information. This is taxing to the brain just like it’s taxing to stay in physical health cohesion ie exercising: discipline. Blind people have to maintain discipline of continually reminding themself of where things are, ie they have to keep regenerating light to keep their reference frame visual. Just like we have to return to a location to be able to remember it’s details but we don’t have to regenerate the light or the reflection of it. So of course society isn’t going to try to create a shared cohesive emotional reality. It’s like asking everyone to recycle correctly or reduce their carbon footprint or floss every day. Too much energy. So there has to be pressure or something else needs to do the work for us so that we have no choice. \\n',\n",
       " 'This feels like a repeated pattern and therefore an old one that probably has played out in different contexts, but I’ve seen in play out in career and relationships: 1) cast net into the world 2) attach to what bites as if that’s the fish you were trying to catch even though it isn’t because you know you need to eat to survive. 3) reel it in only to keep the fish hooked. If it’s not fighting then you don’t have to pay attention to it. If it fights then you have to pay attention to it and keep resistance to keep it hooked. This is a reactionary behavior as opposed to reeling it in because you want THAT fish. If you were reeling it in because you want THAT fish then this is commitment. But if the reeling in is reactionary to the fish’s behavior then it is you feigning to the fish that you want IT but in reality you don’t want it, you just want it to stay hooked until you need the fishing line to catch a better fish that better suits your needs at that moment if it comes along. But remember #2 above, you are making yourself believe you want THAT fish and you are able to do this by contrasting the fish you have baited against both the background of the emptiness of the sea that you see, ie no other fish around, and the fact that you need to eat; and this creates the false language of “I want THIS fish” in your awareness, and it’s false because you are identifying with the empty sea via your hunger and the sea is not you and so the whole the contrast created the correct language based on your identity, it’s false because it’s not your true identity. Because of this false identity to the empty sea through your hunger, you actually believe it is this fish you want. So…4) if another fish comes along that better suits your needs then the contrast against the empty sea disappears and you lose the language “I want THIS fish” (speaking of the original fish). And the new contrast you are making with the old fish is now against the new fish and not the empty sea. You are able to do this because the empty sea is not your true identity and so you can switch out this background with any new background that shows up like this new fish. Now the language created in your head from this new way of contrasting the old fish is “My hunger (survival based dopamine) wants this new fish”. But this reveals you are driven by hunger, not choice, so how do you recreate the illusion, the language “I want the new fish” as opposed to “My hunger wants the new fish”? Interestingly, you create the correct contrast that you should have made when you first encountered the old fish: you contrast the old fish, not against the empty sea, but against yourself, the self that actually knows and knew all along the fish it is looking but was hidden from your awareness up to this point because you never created this contrast until you found a new fish that contrasted against the old fish to produce the language “My hunger wants the new fish”. So now that your hunger wants the new fish, you create the correct contrast because its language “I don’t want the old fish” now contains a survival advantage for you that allows you to have the new fish. But now you have to bait this new fish so you’re back to identifying with the empty sea, with your fear of hunger which gives you the dopamine to bait the fish and creates the false contrast “I want the NEW fish” as opposed to “My fear of hunger wants the new fish” 5) the cycle repeats. This is a very inefficient way of finding a career or partner and forces you to rely way more on luck of the draw than actual hard, dedicated work. I wrote this from observing Meghan but it very much applies to me. This is what I did to Caitlin. This is not what I did to Zannie or Meghan though. I’m trying to reel Meghan in but it’s important to ask if I’m contrasting Meghan off of me or off of the fear of survival surfaced by career and moving. If my career were solved I really don’t feel like I would not want her. What could happen is when I have made a career trajectory cohesive in my reality, to make it cohesive might result in an adjusted orientation of reality kind of like if you have a kid your life changes in major ways—your orientation is life is now more heavily directed at parenthood instead of partying with your friends. This means that an emotional dynamics could have changed its location in reality relative to me or changed its shape or color. It’s like how when you put on contacts all of a sudden your reality has new information and now you can see what’s written on street signs and your interpretation of reality changes. So my dynamic with Meghan could come more into focus as being finite or forever. One thing I am scared of is if she has or doesn’t have internal needs to grow and secure consistent quality time to a level that keeps us fed in an acceptable range: starvation to stuffed. You don’t want to balance in the starved or stuffed side but both can happen sometimes. You need to be balanced where you always feel fed enough to expend energy but not too much to the point of feeling like you’re too heavy to move. Quality time is spatial, time, emotional and sexual, and requires amazing communication ie getting to know each other, not enjoying each other. The bi-product might often be enjoyment but it can also be a lack of enjoyment. Quality time is quality if it increases the knowledge and merging of each other’s emotional reference frame, ie the building, expansion and inpansion, of a shared emotional reality. \\n',\n",
       " 'The center of the universe would maybe be the location that has the most non-uniform 3D spatial cohesion. The most curvature but it may not have a center because it’s finite but spherical and so all points have the same nonuniform spatial cohesion. The center of the universe would only be seen from a 4D cohesive reference frame, not 3D. In 3D, the observable universe has no edges meaning that at any given moment it is finite and limited by the reach of light in all directions and dependent on the precise gravity fields or warping of space-time in that direction. So the observable universe is finite but unbounded and the center is always going to be your spatial reference frame. So it doesn’t make sense to ask where the center of the universe is in 3D cohesive space because it doesn’t all exist in a single reference frame. The only reference frame in which is exists is a 4D cohesive reference frame. The center could be defined for a fixed point in time (and therefore immeasurable) as the point in 3D space such that the time for light to reach the edge is calculated in all infinite directions and the point that minimizes some loss function of each measurement compared to some average of the measurements. This center might be very variable with time based on gravity field changes. \\n',\n",
       " 'Maybe photons have mass but we view it as 0 mass, ie it’s the 0 mass point of a 3D reference frame but it has 4D mass and therefore imparts the ability for EM to carry momentum. In other words, the momentum of 4D mass particles can translate into 3D mass and momentum or just 3D momentum and no mass from our 3D reference frame perspective. Light is somehow such that all of its 4D mass is orthogonal to our 3D cohesive reference frame and therefore all of it’s momentum is fully parallel with our universe. Does this mean you can view total energy as a vector addition of momentum energy and mass energy? In other words, all matter splits its total energy into being contained in mass or momentum. So essentially if we were to move a 4D object the speed of light its 4D mass would be fully converted to 3D momentum. So the EM field is a 4D mass particle that is moving at the speed of light and so all of its energy is translate into momentum in our universe. This aligns with the definition of a 3D massless surface in 4D, what we call the EM field, and so we are the surface of it. So our 3D universe is 4D mass viewed in the direction of its momentum in our reference frame. But we can then split 4D momentum into 3D mass and 3D momentum. \\n',\n",

This should result in the cosmological constant, except that it wouldn’t be constant and would point to a center of the universe, or maybe it’s the radius of our universe measured from its center of curvature so that the cosmological constant is constant. \\n',\n",

So when we die we move from the blanket that covers this eternal reality and we become our consciousness. Just as physical reality was made from as shapes on a uniform surface so that those shapes of awareness could view and perceive physical reality and their place in it, so to was our consciousness made as shapes on an infinite sheet of the infinite consciousness of god so that god could become self aware through our shape, so those shapes could look upon the surface from which they are shaped and to peer all other shapes. \\n',\n",

       " 'I am destroyed Meghan. It’s not that I want to make you hurt of ignore you or discipline or punish you. I literally can’t orient. You added a new dopamine structure to my emotional reality of our dynamic that isn’t safe for me. It’s like how creamsicle feels when you allow the maid to come inside, or a cat in general when a new human is allowed into their home—they don’t know how to orient to their reality anymore. For example, if a new person sits on your bed, what was once Creamsicle’s area of safety now is in question and she doesn’t know where the safest place in her home is anymore—she lost her orientation in her own home. You added a dopamine structure to my emotional reality that is a living entity and so has choice to exist beyond my control or knowledge, and is made from the combination of what in You wanted Dave separate from Me, and what in Dave wanted to find the You that was separate from the You that wanted Me. And because I wasn’t regarded in this transaction, this entity is a stranger in my emotional reality of our dynamic that I didn’t allow inside, and it’s been roaming around my reality the moment you chose to build it so I have no idea the damage or the changes it has made to my reality of our dynamic. If you found out that a stranger had snuck into your home and then left, the first thing you would do is search around your house for any changes, anything damaged or stolen so that you can fix, reconfirm or reorient to a new reality; and this is regardless of whether or not they were a thief. Imagine if your roommate let their partner into your room: everything is probably fine but still someone was in a place you didn’t allow. But even if all is fine in the present, a question of the future remains, and I don’t know how to orient in a reality where I can’t trust my roommate to respect my safety, or to hurt me in the light. I do have stuff to work on, of course. I hurt you in the light, you hurt me in the dark. The former is like a cut on your skin which allows you to treat the wound immediately, whereas the latter is like a virus that is allowed to wreak havoc on your body for weeks before you can start treating it. I’m not saying that what I did is any less wounding in the present. In fact, my behavior is way more wounding in the present. But yours wounds the future far more. As “Seneca” said last night “A punch you can see lands softer”. I am not looking for someone who won’t hurt me, I am looking for someone who will let me brace for the impact, a dynamic where when we have no choice but to hurt the other we shine a light on every part of our body that is moving so that our partner can not only protect themself but also protect the dynamic from ourself, trusting that they won’t retaliate and won’t runaway unless that’s the only option. I don’t know how to orient when I feel like I’m in the dark. The dark is scary even if no one is throwing punches. Meghan’s emotional processing is responsive and reactionary. It’s like a candle that has to be lit by someone else as opposed to being able to create the combustion itself. She developed an inappropriate–with respect to our dynamic–dopamine structure with another guy behind my back–this is my new definition of cheating; she cheated on me. She then proceeded to hide it and keep it as a secret source of dopamine for whenever she may need it as a response to our relationship and getting her needs met that our relationship wasn’t meeting and that she didn’t communicate to me so that I could create that for her. She says it’s because she didn’t want to add more to my plate but selfish people give unselfish reasons so my guess is that there was a need she felt that I couldn’t offer. This guy had more energy, more dopamine for her to build off of, younger, more interested in her, in a setting that was external and not on my couch, she was bored. This would have been fine to do if she communicated and allowed our dynamic a chance to build the dopamine structure she needed or to resolve the need by identifying it for what it is: the definition of growing toward each other. But this takes effort and this guy offered her something quick and easy that seemed to have no consequence cause what would it matter to just take a little bite, like that 1 cigarette a year, and she was right: it wasn’t the bite or the food she ingested that mattered, it was that it was done in opposition to our dynamic. She looked at what she was offered thinking that that was all she had to analyze cause that’s the only thing new in the environment not realizing that to take a bite hidden from our dynamic required her to leave our dynamic. Each person in a dynamic carries their own reality of the attachments involved. So Meghan may have different perception of the flexibility of her attachment to our dynamic to allow her to think that she can stretch to take a bite, but what she didn’t realize is that when I find out what she did that it is in my reality that she makes that choice, not her own, and in my reality her attachment has different properties such that her act of taking a bite created a rip in our dynamic. She didn’t stretch like she thought she did, she tore from our dynamic like one half of a Siamese twin. It was only then that she (and me) realized that our emotional realities did not coincide, were not shared, and as such she would continue to make movements that could create tears in my reality and she wouldn’t know it. But to save the relationship, she as a sociopath adopts any part of my reality that has been revealed to her that threatens her not getting what she wants: me. One can’t earn their way to forgiveness, they must remain lost while they search for it until they find it and even then the door has to be opened from the inside. Meghan helping me find houses and putting in effort with a new found fervor isn’t for me, it’s her way of meeting a need that her behavior has created, a response to me removing something of value from her. By leaving her I am subjecting her to her own creation with Dave. She built a dopamine structure in her emotional reality by cutting out a hole in our dynamic. Because it’s dopamine, it has emotional gravity but in the context of our dynamic which has much more gravity, she can stay attached to the surface of our dynamic while also keeping this new dopamine structure present. It’s like how we aren’t pulled away by the Sun’s gravitational pull while on Earth because the Earth’s gravity is stronger and so we can have the sun while living on the Earth. But what happens if you were to remove the gravitational pull of the Earth all of a sudden? A vacuum would be created and you would accelerate toward the Sun instantly and without choice. Meghan created a dopamine structure that has its own gravity but far enough away from the surface of our dynamic that she can enjoy its warmth while also staying planted on the surface where she wants to live. When I leave the relationship as a response to her doing this, the gravitational pull of our dynamic is removed even if the surface isn’t meaning that our dynamic exists but the entity that was the source of its gravitational pull (the graviton) which is my life force was removed and so now the gravitation of the Sun (dopamine structure that gave her warmth) that she created with Dave will now immediately be the object with the strongest gravitational force and she will float toward it without a present choice but as a result of a past choice and what once was warmth to her will eventually burn her like fire. She can’t just destroy the Sun (dopamine structure) just from our reality which is what she did when she finally set a boundary, she has to have destroyed it from her own reality. So if she really did as she claimed to do and our dynamic is truly safe from this dopamine structure then she would have had to destroy this structure not only in my reality and our shared reality of our dynamic but also in her own cause as soon as I remove my gravity from her, the only reality that matters is her own and its the gravity in her reality that will direct her now. If she didn’t actually protect our dynamic by destroying the dopamine structure in her own reality and had conscious or unconscious intention of keeping the Sun in her reality and dimming it in ours and mine, then by me leaving she will gravitate toward it when I’m gone and I will see the truth of her. If she truly protected our dynamic by destroying the Sun in her reality and by default destroys it in our shared reality and my own reality, then she will not be pulled away from the surface of our dynamic even though I removed my gravity. She will just have her true self and an object at rest stays at rest so if there are no other gravitational fields around then even if I take my gravity away she will stay put until I come back because she would have made a choice prior to me removing my gravity that she doesn’t want to leave the surface and so she will have no choice but to remain until I come back. I am truly sorry for hurting you, Meghan, and throwing some punches that you didn’t know how to defend against except to run for the dark. I broke a different kind of trust and I don’t blame you or see you as responsible for my pain. My suffering isn’t coming from the wounds that we have inflicted on ourselves or each other; wounds heal. As you sort of alluded to earlier, the suffering comes from losing you in my reality. When two people have good emotional intent, they are both the source and destination of any pain or pleasure they create whether created from the light or the dark. But when created from the dark, the location where both of you generated the pain, and the location where both of you received the pain are not the same and so you are at different vantage points as if only one is the source and only one is the receiver and so are separate. And if the casm created by the impact is too large, the separation may never end. \\n',\n",
       " 'Healing is a type of growth. Therefore, in any dynamic if you heal together you grow together, and if you heal apart you grow apart. But healing apart may sometimes be the only way to heal, especially when one has wounded you in the dark and running to get away is equivalent to running to the light and is therefore separation from the person that caused the wound. But what this kind of healing does is take you back to the question, back to a choice, the original choice at the moment you met them, the choice that you took with you from the ending of the last relationship to the new one: to grow separate or to grow together. We don’t choose who to love, we choose who to grow alongside and if done right love is the experience of the process. Sometimes you have to heal apart so that you can reconfirm your choice to grow together, not with the same person but with the new person who has healed, not to resurrect what had died but to create a new dynamic with the foundation of the original. Sometimes the first dynamic is just meant to lay and then test the foundation, that even if what is built atop of it is destroyed by a storm, the foundation remains sound. And then you know that you have solved the most important problem: how to build a dynamic that can’t be uprooted. This is the most important because a sound foundation can always be built upon again and again and will allow a dynamic the opportunity to experiment with how to build a sound house on top of an already sound foundation. Without a sound foundation, one may only get a single chance to learn how to build a house and will take little knowledge with them to the next. When you have confirmed the foundation is solid, then you can move on to the second most important problem: how to build a sound structure of the home. Then the fun problems that make it all worth the effort: all of its internals and externals. \\n',\n",
       " 'I would venture to guess that the brain not only processes the 5 senses through the emotional processing center, but that emotions are processed, organized, understood, differentiated, translated from within the same processing units of the 5 sense in order to search for new and real emotional contrasts and therefore a deeper understanding of one’s emotional existence. For me in particular, I had survival pressure put on me by my emotional environments where if I didn’t expand my emotional awareness I was going to commit suicide. My brain got the signal that it needed to expand and create new ways of emotional processing or it would die. At the exact same time, I started taking psychedelics and in particular Molly and Ketamine, and this was on top of the extra dopamine and norepinephrine I was getting from daily prescribed Adderall of 30mg. I believe on a few serendipitous occasions the combination of ketamine, Molly and Adderall created new roads in my brain accessible by areas in my brain that store emotional memories and receive input, they weakened the dam containing my emotions and like the pressure of water against a weakened dam, the survival pressure coming from my stored and triggered emotional memories broke through the constraints of the dam confining them to a location no longer suited and like water never misses an opportunity to flow, my emotions flooded all the neighboring processing centers of my brain violently expanding like an emotional Big Bang: Truth. A quick expansion ensued followed by a dark period as emotional gravity had enough time to bring emotional matter together into new galaxies of emotional processing were formed. Emotional Suns starting their engine, creating for the first time a stable source of emotional light that gives confirmation of the true and undeniable structure of the emotional universe that has been formed and is still forming. And at some point I thought this universe became static, slowing its expansion, had stretched out to the furthest reaches that the original explosion could allow. But I peered deep into this universe collecting the light from its edges and found that it isn’t slowing down, it’s accelerating. How is this? Conscious energy using dopamine as the dark energy as if to reach from my prefrontal cortex inward into the brain and grab the edges of this emotional universe and stretch it toward and into my prefrontal cortex. It’s like the original emotional Big Bang stretched out its hand in all directions and my prefrontal cortex reached out its dopamine hand and their reach was just far enough to grab hold and my prefrontal cortex as been pulling my emotional brain to safety. This is the second source of gravitational pull in the brain and while from the perspective of the internals of the emotional universe where gravity attracts this second source of gravity appears to be a repelling source, it’s actually the same gravitational force, just a stronger one and the most important, like the Sun is the most important and strongest gravitational force from the perspective of the Earth. The gravity that creates the expansion of our universe is its 4D sun, the source of 4D life, and just like the Earth is in balance with the Suns gravitation so is our universe in balance with its 4D sun. It appears that it isn’t but our universe reaches out for this pull to give itself life and meaning, to give itself expression and true light, and life and true light reaches out for it. My emotional universe is meaningless without the connection between it and the object in my brain that can bring it into reality, into existence. My emotional universe reaches out for awareness, and my awareness reaches out for consciousness for both are lost without the other, both are the source and destination of life and light and purpose, they live as one or the exist as none. This universe is the consciousness of reality and whatever we are expanding toward, whatever is creating an external pull on our universe is the universes awareness, its counterpart, the other side of its life equation, its home. So what is the awareness of the universe. A consciousness without an awareness might as well not exist, and an awareness without a consciousness is just an echo falling deeper into silence. Consciousness reaches out forward for Truth for Knowledge, and Awareness reaches back for Life for Existence, and when they find each other they combine to create Intelligent Life, for life without knowledge is instinct, and knowledge without life is formless. Life gives function to Truth, and Truth gives meaning to Life, and when Intelligent Life has function and meaning, it creates purpose. The definition of purpose is movement of Intelligent Life.         \\n',\n",

You chose to be the glue and because of that gift, you turned hope into knowledge. Until you, this new version of me didn’t know if a romantic dynamic could have real love in it, or if it was a mirage that perished with my old reality built from trauma. Your presence not only brought romantic love into my vision, you gave me the clarity that awkwardness was its shape, that growth was its texture, that it sustains its own existence and so I know it isn’t created and molded, it’s found and explored. I’m in a lot of pain especially considering it’s AA night and that now brings a wave of sickness over me. Absolutely terrible timing. I can’t think of a worse day to have been our first day apart. It just further stretches this already nearly uncrossable chasm of separation, and it hurts so I have no idea where I am and how to figure it out. The object of romantic love that we found just wasn’t at a size that created a long term relationship or she left it and I was left alone to explore it. Also, the beginning of our relationship and all my inspection and “testing” wasn’t a creation and molding of love, it was the search for it and it led us to a structure of Love and in the exploration of it we got cut by some sharp edges and fell off while climbing on top of it and like Taco when she tried to climb the child gate and it toppled over onto her and now she’s terrified to go near it because she doesn’t understand that the gate didn’t choose to topple over, Meghan and I became afraid of what we found as if it cut us, as if it kicked us off and made us fall to the ground, not realizing that it was our carelessness and our choice to jump off from too high a point that injured us to the point where we both left the shared reality in which it lives to go back to our safe reality where it doesn’t. I’m hurt and I’m grateful. Just like love, we don’t create an uncrossable chasm that separates two people in a dynamic, we stumble upon it. I am grateful that we both learned the landscape of our dynamic before any further sacrifices were made to keep ourselves in it. While part of me is bothered by the prospect of you unpausing the emotional gravity that you have been building with Dave, if its gravity does pull you in because you no longer have a stronger gravity keeping you from it, I do hope you develop it into something good and meaningful. I’m sorry you’re having a hard time, and I’m sad that your claims to hold on barely lasted 12 hours. I am sending good wishes to you in terms of Dave in the eventual sense, not tonight. Eventually the loss of us won’t have gravity in your reality and given the speed by which you let go 86 won’t be long before that gravity disappears completely and you’ll be left with the gravity that remains in your life. We don’t choose to follow the gravity we create. We choose to create the gravity and then become willing or unwilling participants in its pull. You created something, it now has gravity in your reality just like the gravity I created from career and housing. I don’t know how you could have let us go the way you did, but the gravity you created, you needed and I’m probably fully to blame for creating the need, but now that you filled the spot with something other than our dynamic I hope it continues to be a positive force for meeting your needs. I do hope you have a great time at AA. Not to be melodramatic lol, but I will be counting how many pieces my heart can break into and wondering for what I am reconnecting them. BTW, I get the feeling that you may have done something physical you’re not willing to tell me about, perhaps as far back as months ago like the night you spent an hour talking with him at AA. That you actually traveled the path to its end and that’s why you know it leads nowhere. That you got it out of your system already and that’s why you know you want to still be with me, but you told me only as much as would separate you far enough from the awareness of your selfishness while keeping the risk that you would lose me from what you divulged to a minimum. I just see no other way for him to believe there’s an open door and be so persistent. I was waiting for you today to make the choice to share it all and hold nothing back and make the whole story from months ago till now cohesive for us so that we could move on. I know it’s probably unlikely that there is more to the story or more to add to make it cohesive but it’s still not fully cohesive in my head of how this happened. If there’s something big to come clean about, you’ve got to face it. I came fully clean with Dulcie, made everything cohesive for her, and it literally saved my life.\\n',\n",
       " 'Emotional smell is how we navigate the building of an emotional dynamic to keep it healthy and fresh and nutritious as well as combined with emotional sight. When I looked around at my decorated home and said “this is all wrong” it was emotional smell. Or that I needed to move, it was emotional smell, not sight. When I knew to break it off with Meghan or get more Truth out of her, that was emotional smell. When I felt like she was in the darkness and sociopathic, that was emotional smell because sociopaths don’t have a smell. They, and sociopathic behaving people like inverted Narcissits, are only detectable by emotional smell because they use the fact that there is no emotional light and they can lie and say they are something they are not and get away with it. But emotional smell doesn’t require light. Emotions have a distinct smell so when someone is not putting their true self into a dynamic there is no smell. Sociopaths can create the illusion that they are there but they have no idea how to create the illusion of emotional smell. \\n',\n",
       " 'Emotional feeling is the equivalent of seeing a single object of emotion. Emotional sight is seeing the space between objects. Eyesight isn’t the ability to see objects, it’s the ability to see the space between them. Light enters the brain, and then the visual cortex processes the negative space and then projects out the rest. This is similar to how a color in reality absorbs all frequencies except for the frequency we see. Our conscious doesn’t see space, it looks empty. This means our brain absorbs the negative space between light and then projects the rest. This is why empty space is dark because our visual cortex sees space and we see what our visual cortex doesn’t and therefore our conscious sees nothing. With a light shining in your face, there is no space so our visual cortex sees nothing and is blind but our conscious sees all of it. So emotional sight occurs when you use your visual cortex to see the space between emotional objects thereby putting them in the same universe and creating a cohesive reality. Emotional feeling is like how when you get to know someone, they start to look different to you as if another dimension to their existence exists but this is not emotional sight. This implies that touch is actually the sensory organ that allows us to truly see objects as they actually are, not as light and our brain chooses to see them. Every characteristic of an object seen through vision is perception cause it isn’t true seeing of the object but feeling is true vision of an object. So emotional feeling allows us to directly see emotional objects, and raw emotions processed through the visual cortex allow us to see the space between emotional objects. So when we get to know someone and their physical appearance changes to us like they appear more or less attractive, that is processed emotional feeling merged with processed physical light in the visual cortex. But if in addition the raw emotions are processed in the visual cortex and then emotional feelings are merged with the processed physical light and emotional light then in addition to projecting the emotional feelings onto their physical appearance, the emotional empty space between each person in a room is also projected and immediately emotional spatially cohesive reality exists ie just like a dimension of emotional feelings is layered onto the physical appearance of a person, a dimension of emotional space is layered onto physical space and an emotional spatial cohesive reality comes into existence. And to smell emotions there must be a medium through which the emotional objects that create smell can float to our brain ie because the visual cortex sees empty space and doesn’t project it out it retains this information in our brain and it’s this space through which our brain redirects raw emotions to be processed through the olfactory from the hippocampus or amygdala, meaning that the visual cortex is what unlocks the ability for raw emotions to be processed through other parts of the brain like the olfactory. Rather, the visual cortex is the channel through which our brain is capable of interpreting emotions through the olfactory instead of throwing it away because it can’t make sense of where the emotional smell is coming from without believing or knowing that there is an emotional reality in which it flowed to our brain (knowing where it comes from, knowing that it is coming from emotional reality, etc). Like a cat, the brain then knows to hold onto these emotional smells in its memory and then compare and contrary and match smells and create conscious language from them to then make identification of emotional smells in reality quick and broad and deep. Cats live in a vastly different cohesive space than we do given how many smells they can pick up and this allows them to see far to navigate more effectively to avoid danger. They just lack the intelligence to do more complex things with their smell reality like combine ingredients to create their own unique smells that make them happier. I am at the level of a cat with emotional smell, meaning I can’t yet combine say people in a room to create a unique and beautiful odor that translates into a group that can collaborate well or get along ie like a team. Maybe one day emotional intelligence will allow me to do interesting things like that. Emotional taste does not yet make sense to me but it follows that emotional taste would not develop until emotional smell has given that a lot of what we taste is through smell. The brain is naturally driven to make its reality singular, to make it cohesive and so the pinnacle of humanity that I can predict is one in which spatial cohesion is a seamless projection from the brain of the 5 sense of physical reality and the projection of raw emotions processed through all of those same 5 senses, projected into their individual spatially cohesive reference frame—physical and emotion—and then seamlessly layered over each other and projected externally onto physical reality for the conscious intelligence to experience and make sense out of. \\n',\n",
       " 'Your attachment should always remain potential until it has been proven to be shared. Emotional sight, emotional feeling, emotional smell, emotional hearing, emotional taste are all used to verify of something is truly in a shared external reality. If these don’t create a cohesive signal in your emotional reference frame that is tuned to the supposed emotional dynamic ie interpreted in the context of the raw emotional language defining the dynamic then it isn’t real and it isn’t shared. Btw, speaking raw emotional language is the ability to project various dimensions of processed emotional language onto a cohesive emotional reference frame and therefore interpret and experience them cohesively—that’s what makes it “raw” but raw in the sense of independently processed dimensions of the same emotional environment rather than a single processed dimension that is projected into the physical cohesive reference frame. Emotions are native to the emotional cohesive reference frame but if one does not exist then they get projected onto a non-native cohesive reference frame, the physical one. The human consciousness is able to have multiple cohesive reference frames of reality so far only physical and emotional. Without a spatially cohesive reference frame we do not exist. It is this reference frame that defines our awareness. Time is projected onto a 3D spatially cohesive physical reference frame because humans have yet to develop a 4D spatially cohesive physical reference frame and so Time appears to us as a flat dimension, the flatness of which we interpret and give the name of Time. Emotions is the name we give to the flatness we experience of emotional reality. But Time is meant to be cohesive with physical space in order for us to experience it in its raw form instead of a translated form. Emotions have their own dimensions of cohesive reality and is the reality of our awareness, ie whatever is not in our physical reference frame, what is not projected. \\n',\n",

       " 'When you have the intent to love and you honor it to its fullest extent by making all movements in the light through true honest expression and communication of the self to your partner whether the content exposes your bad or good, you are living in full control over the questions and answers that define your participation in the dynamic. You are able to move yourself back to a question state and into a new answer. By being honest you are protecting your own power over the emotions evoked in you in the relationship. You are curating your own experience, balanced with your partner, and if it ever is curated by the other in a way you don’t like you can rebalance the dynamic through new answers and communication, and this can lead to deeper growth in the dynamic, meaning better answers, new questions, new answers, reconfirmation of answers; or it can lead to a disintegration or collapse or unraveling of the dynamic ie the answers are collapsing back into question and staying there or resulting in more shallow answers that soon collapse back into question and then into a shallower answer and then back into question until the question disappears entirely. At some point, the momentum of the relationship is in the direction of shallower answers and questions disappearing, belief has been lost and answers become more shallow and questions start to disappear and no longer be asked and the dynamic disintegrates. But when you had the intent to love the whole time, each move back to the question, each shallower answer, each question that disappears is your 100% choice because each person has their own question and answer path that defines the dynamic. Communicating is meant to keep these the same but sometimes a person keeps secrets about where they are in their question-answer path and you lose the unique set of question and answers that defines where they are and you can search and search by doing a permutation search of your own question-answer path but ultimately the drift often becomes too big and either they can’t be found or they left the dynamic a long time ago and their path disintegrated and just didn’t tell you. But even if that’s the case, when you have intent to love you do do a search in your own path for them and when you realize they can’t be found or that they left or broke their own path and so there is no combination of question-answer to get back to them, you are able to not only demolish your own path of the dynamic, you are able to remove your full self (all emotion) with 100% choice from it before doing so. If instead a part of your trauma self has created questions and/or answers in your path of the dynamic and not demolished by you through the communication to your partner and owning up to it, then when you or your partner demolish the dynamic you have two choices: 1) remove your full awareness of self including your trauma and by doing so you are saving your awareness from experiencing, numbness but with the consequence that you are choosing to reintegrate your trauma as part of yourself, 2) Ask the question of who am I by looking upon your path of the dynamic as if a mirror of the self and determine which paths are the true you versus the false self, and then only take back what is the true self and leave the parts of the path that are the false self to perish in the collapse of that dynamic. This is the pain I used to feel when losing relationships. The part of my false self in my brain was attached to the path of the dynamic that was external to me and when that dynamic would collapse it would pull out the false self out like tying a string to a loose tooth and to a door knob and then opening the door quickly. The thread of that false self would be pulled out of the fabric of my awareness like a barbed arrow out of my body and create so much pain in the process. But when you only allow your true self to be in a dynamic and actively destroy the paths of the false self that are created in real time by communication with your partner, if the relationship ends you are able to safely and confidently take all of you out of the dynamic before you collapse it without numbing and therefore without suffering: grief without suffering, grief without sociopathy, grief with empathy, grief with true ego, grief in aloneness without being lonely. But if you have a false self in there then you must choose suffering, suicide or numbness, the last one is what most people choose. When I have an intent to love someone, it’s never gone until they clearly reject it either by letting too much time pass and not repairing, moving on, not taking responsibility, or explicitly expressing it, or I have shifted that question to someone new. The question that isn’t demolished by my choice but by theirs is “Do I intend to love this person?”. The answer to that question remains a “Yes” at all times and is the start of a true chemical bond and stays there until the other person demolishes it because it is a gift to them to keep the light on. There is a way for Meghan to recreate that dynamic if she were to get me to want to turn the light on that same question she had for me. Trauma allows false ego to enter the dynamic with its own question-answer agenda and if your girlfriend cheats on you for example then the poison flowing through your question-answer path evokes emotions throughout the path including the ones that represent the false ego and so the false ego reacts in intense emotion like a parasite trying to stay alive and trick your true self into letting it manipulate the partner who hurt you to resolve the pain you are feeling in the dynamic and then it gains more and more control and more pain awaits with the relationship ends, instead of not having the false ego and then being able to make the choice to leave in peace, to avoid the poison, not react to it only to search for the antidote in your partner through control and manipulation. Meghan emotionally smelled exactly like my Invitae boss, Alex Furman! Willing to take critique and feedback and promise shit and then never fulfill on those promises and continue to act in the dark and then repeat the process. I just dated my boss! Gross!! So just like Alex she will say nice things as I leave but won’t ever reach out again and will just reorient back to her sociopathic self. Having learned from emailing Alex that he let go because he was never attached or honest or true, it’s clear that reaching out to Meghan will have the same result: she will be dead and though she would probably respond it wouldn’t be the Meghan I thought I saw, she will not respond. It will just be the Meghan she hid from me and willing to allow me to crawl back into a web of her own making. Meghan knew she couldn’t feed off of me but other people fell into her web like Dave, a small ant, and so still wondering if I was something she could feed off of and therefore in a state of hunger she fed off the blood of the ant that she has eaten before and knows is nutritious and hid it from me lest she exposes her intentions, her true nature of self, her true form as a black widow. I so want to expose her to herself but then it isn’t her choice to see it and that’s the same as killing her. I can only confirm it if she ever arrives there on her own. But perhaps she never will and her true consciousness will need to come back to this Earth another time. She’s a black widow which is an amazing analogy because it was while with her that I was worried about black widows in the abandoned back yard that taco would roam around it, and I saw 2 black widows including one with her that I pointed out to her and that she said she had never seen! And I said, I want to kill it to protect taco but I feel like they have their place in this world and I trust the universe to keep taco safe. This tells me that I should not try to emotionally harm Meghan anymore. I got her to travel back into her cave to protect the part of me that is Taco (intent to love). I do not need to wait for her to come back out or try to entice her out (black widows won’t come out unless they want to anyway and will only do so if they believe its in their best interest–she didn’t want me leaving her web but she somehow knew that I was too big of a meal and would destroy her if she tried to feed) and squish her to preemptively protect Taco (my intent to love). Instead, she looked at me cause I triggered her web and she wondered what I was, if I was devourable, and instead of squishing her our of fear, I allowed her mistake to come out of her cave not result in her death by staying with her until she cheated on the dynamic which was her crawling back into her hole once she realized that she had two choices: run away or be squished because they choice she didn’t have was to not be a black widow. Meghan only knows how to feed and how to hide and she has no choice because that is her role as she is now, as I used to be in my numbness. If I don’t let her come back on her own accord then I will take away her ability to transform herself. My final gift of love to her is to let her go and to let her find her way back. If she does before I have started a new path then a path between her and I is possible but if she doesn’t then there was never a path to be walked with her that took either of us closer to our consciousnesses. Our current dynamic dead ended and would have only led us back toward a false reality. It wasn’t the true consciousness of Meghan that is the black widow, it’s the consciousness that her awareness of life created in response to her experience in this world. If I were to kill that false consciousness I would destroy her awareness with it for they are the same and by doing so I am going against the tenant of love which is to bring others closer to their true consciousness by reorienting their awareness to it, not destroying it to protect the self. We learn the most about how to love when it is the hardest to choose, and we separate the parts of our true self from all other parts when we choose to love in the hardest situations because to choose love one has to have seen that the part of the self that is in danger of dying or being poisoned by the black widow isn’t the true self and so one is not in danger. One cannot love in a given environment unless they are able to see their true self separate from the part of awareness that is subject to the death in that environment. If one does not see a self in that environment then they are free to love for if death strikes in that environment no part of the self was sacrificed. The universe protects me because what is false, the poison that comes from it only exists in the false reality, not the true reality and so when one’s awareness walks the bridge between the false reality of false egos and the reality of true consciousness the poison of the false reality, all of its creatures and monsters can’t follow and would cease to exist if they took one step on that bridge. To take a single step on the bridge is to choose to be stripped of all that is false, of all its power therein, to be naked and cold and weak but free of death, free of false, not free of pain but free of slavery to it, free of the need to fight for one’s life because the bridge you walk upon–the universe–supports the true self, is the ground upon which you learn to stand, learn to walk, learn to sit, learn to sleep, learn to jump, learn to run, learn to spring, learn to grow, learn to trust and with every step you learn more about the universe and your consciousness comes into view; all that is false falls through the material of the bridge for truth does not interact with false lest we make our mutations into gods and destroy ourselves; this is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Adam and Eve eating from the tree of life is symbolic of a brain or species capable of building its own false reality of false egos, ie false consciousness, ie false gods (because god is consciousness). Then God said “cast them out lest they eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil”. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil is the bridge that links the reality of false gods/consciousnesses to the reality of true consciousnesses/the true God which is the entire landscape of that reality. Now, this is an allegory and just means that God built a bridge between these two realities so that we would not die in our own false reality and had a way back to our true reality such that nothing of the false is capable of coming with. Had we been able to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil that would have been the equivalent of god choosing to allow the false reality to exist in the true reality and that would have been the equivalent of God choosing suicide. So I am protected by the support of the bridge, not by the support of the false reality, even in death and especially in life. There is no eden, this is all an allegory. The words are false but the concept is sound. God created consciousnesses to be its awareness but to be a consciousness it needed life, life is the power of god ie the ability to create a consciousness but not the ability to give it eternal life for that isn’t an ability but rather an intrinsic property of God’s consciousness as it is infinite. So God had to give these consciousnesses life and by doing so these consciousnesses automatically exercise the creation of an awareness of external life. Then in the contrast of what is external and everything else that created the landscape of a false reality on which the awareness can choose to paint itself and look upon its art and call it a consciousness (just like the art of an artist is an expression of the artist but not the artist: art is a false reality. When the art becomes the reality of the artist, the true artist has committed suicide). Or they can fulfill their purpose and instead of creating a false consciousness they can search for the consciousness from which they sprung. This is the only free-will of a brain: to choose to be its own god, or to choose to find god; to choose to create a life from within its own to complete the circle, or to search for the source that gave it life; to sacrifice its power to create for itself as the center of its own reality, for the power to walk in search of the center of true reality: its own god-given consciousness. Happiness can be anything you want it to be in the world of awareness, but in the world of consciousness the you that is its awareness only has life inasmuch as it is in alignment with your consciousness and by not choosing to walk in the direction of truth, toward the consciousness you may end up having to come back to this Earth as a new human or animal to try again until the day your awareness has achieved its full life. Rest assured, all the lives you live will not be happy or easy because a real life (awareness = consciousness) is the hardest intelligence to master, the steepest path to walk, with the darkest nights and the coldest days, the thinnest atmosphere and the roughest terrain, for what would be a better contrast to create the language of True Life than to walk a path of certain death and survive. For the effort you arrive at the highest peak, the freshest air, the mountain top that all others look up to, a height that allows you to look down at your world at what you have and there is nothing to look upward toward at what you have yet to achieve, and not in pride or dominion or power or control but in awe. The job of the awareness is to build consciousness of life to the true consciousness but if your awareness is bringing life to a false consciousness of its own making then when your awareness dies with the physical brain that sustains it and therefore so does its false consciousness. And all the pleasure or pain that the false consciousness experienced was for nothing and it certainly wasn’t to bring that false consciousness to life because it is idiotic to try to bring life to something that is false, that cannot contain life; so if it wasn’t to bring something else life, then it was to trick itself from the fear of death; it’s the response of dissociating from the truth of death. From the moment we are born, we are surrounded by hungry lions and the span of our physical life is just the time it takes for the lions to reach us. We can close our eyes and imagine a different reality and dissociate out of fear, or we can use the time we get to ignore the lions and look up and see that our true life is to bring awareness of god to god and that through our response to inevitable death is how this is done; it is the only external pressure that will get us to look up even though most choose to shut their eyes until its over. Without this pressure, we would keep our eyes open and never look up and therefore exist without ever having true purpose which is the eternal suffering. There is no hell, but it was the alternative to death. Hell is eternal life without purpose, for any false purpose we would create to fill the gap would just be finite and decay and eventually the finite world we live in would run out of permutations from which we can create fresh purpose and we would live in a world of fully digested finite purpose and exist in our own shit forever. Death, rebirth, death, rebirth, is a gift that allows us to fulfill an infinite purpose because we bring awareness to an infinite life. Just like we can’t create a reflection of ourself off of ourself, awareness cannot breath life into its own creation separate from its own life so when the awareness dies so to does the false consciousness it created; what is finite can only create finite, and what is finite can never become infinite and so all that is finite must decay to zero, and what is infinite must always remain for decay has no power over it. This is more proof that God is The Infinite and that nothing in our existence that we can be aware of or experience or measure or know or see can be infinite for to look upon infinity is to become zero. Finite only perceives itself as non-zero and existing because it contrasts itself against non-zero, finite things. Anything that is finite that contrasts itself against true infinity, not perceived or believed infinity, automatically becomes zero and is the equivalent of death. Physical death is the contrast against a true infinity, against god. False ego is the act of comparing one’s finite only against other finite entities that ensure the contrast, the ratio is above 1. Narcissists try to create and force another’s finiteness closer and closer toward zero so that they can create a false contrast or perception in which they are growing to infinity: a false god and is the direction of false god. False egos move in this direction: the direction toward infinity just like our universe is trying to expand to infinity, or move others to infinity ie self abandonment, or tries to collapse themself to zero by searching to create against infinity leading to suicide. But True Ego seeks out other finites that are in search of their full dimension of finiteness and not interested in creating a perception of infinity so as to bring all others to death, or creating infinity to others so as to lead others to death, or to collapse itself to zero so as to bring death to itself. True Ego seeks for other finite entities also in search of their true finiteness so that the contrast brings both to an awareness of true consciousness. In order to be with god, one must learn the landscape on which their finiteness is formed. If you search for zero, or search for infinity, or bring others to zero or bring others to infinity you learn nothing of this landscape. But if you search for your finiteness through true contrasts then you learn your landscape and conquer it so as to stand at its peak and from this peak you can look upon the fuller landscape against which your self is given form and structure and uniqueness and purpose and existence and differentiation; you look upon god and realize that to be with the finiteness of your true consciousness is to be with the infiniteness of God. Each life we live on this planet, either as a human or animal or ant or future evolved species, is to get a little closer to the peak of our consciousness. The purpose of this finite life perhaps is to get the combined awarenesses to the peak of the consciousness from which they came, and once the cohesive body built from this collective existence of awarenesses reaches the peak the consciousness has achieved full life capable of looking upon the landscape of God’s consciousness and use that full life to bring awareness to God of itself. And we are promised that it will end because what is finite can never be made infinite so the collective body of awareness must be made of a finite amount of awarenesses. While each awareness may be in the memory of the life that sits atop the peak of a consciousness, it has no life and so this solves the paradox of if that life is infinite then the probability that we are aware of a finite life is 0. Just like adding a new dimension to spatial cohesive requires the previous cohesive reality to be demolished and then a new higher dimensional cohesive reference frame to be built, so to does the awareness of the life that climbs the mountain of our consciousness such that the collection of awarenesses that it contains must be built together into a cohesive awareness of life reference frame and so no single awareness that represents a dimension of that awareness of life will be aware of itself just like the left and right direction, forward backward, up and down directions cannot be separated from 3D cohesive reality into its own existence: 3D exists together or not at all. The life of our true self won’t come into existence until all the dimensions of its awareness (all awareness that have existed) have been collected and a single cohesive God-reality reference frame of all these awarenesses is created but no single one of them existing because a true cohesive reference frame, without being impacted by an external force, its resting state, is to have no orientation and so the true awareness of the true self consciousness is aware of the concept of each individual awareness but can’t live through them. This is the only way in which we can exist finitely here but part of an infinite, eternal existence elsewhere: cohesion of awareness of life. This means all true awarenesses of the true self are necessarily built from at least 2 finite awarenesses. It could also be the case that all true cohesive awareness reference frames are already built or designed but come into existence by collapsing all other dimensions than the one that is being lived, creating a brain, and this is why we live as a single awareness at a time and do so until all dimensions have been created singularly. Then the cohesive awareness comes to life. This also means that this awareness can orient itself in any way it wants up to external forces, ie just like we can decide what is left and right, forward and backward in a continuous, smooth way, so to can our full cohesive awareness make combinations of each dimension of awareness to create an orientation of God-reality to always know where it is and to share a reality with others. For example, to walk with someone is to orient in the same direction as to what is forward and backward but as soon as we are no longer walking with them we can orient forward and backward any way we want because we are no longer sharing reality; and this is what movement, choice, free-will is: the ability to update your orientation on will alone. But we must stay on the surface of god’s consciousness so there will be an external force in God-reality that forces a single orientation just like we orient up and down separate from all others, and this orientation is the one that always ensures we are walking with god ie that we never leave god’s surface. All other orientations are ours to choose. So somehow, this idea of heaven is that the movements that we make are combinations of the awarenesses we built from our Earth lives and through these combinations we are able to explore the infinite landscape of God and do so with others like how when at the peak of a mountain we can choose to look in any angle with ease whereas on our way up the mountain itself would not allow that cohesion. True Life is the fullest cohesion possible so until we reach the peak we do not have true life but rather we are building toward full cohesion.                \\n',\n",
       " 'Being with Meghan’s awareness of life felt like it was suppressing me from moving in life, not energizing me to move. So the analogy that her awareness of life is a black widow fits even better because a web restricts movements. She will let you enjoy her web and let you move however you want but will not let you go and then when you’re tired and can no longer move in life her black widow self will come out and devour you until you are no longer nutritious. But with me, she was confused because she hadn’t ever met a life form too big for her web and so just like a human can, I was able to shake around her web and even break it or take my hand away when she tried to come out to feed. She has never met anyone capable of choosing to go in and out of her web at will so she had to endure my disturbances of her home until I was done. If I didn’t have the intent to love though, then I could have lost awareness just enough for her to come out and bite me just like it can to a human, but since I remained in truth she never could sneak out and bite me while I was playing around with her web. If she tried to bite I would simply take my hand away. So she fed elsewhere out of my sight while I played with her web and then when I learned that she was sucking the life out of others it was only then that I saw the type of life form her awareness of life is and so instead of playing with fire and instead of destroying her out of spite or fear, I just let her be in her small little dwelling on this earth and moved on down the street to explore some more. It’s also interesting that it was only this year that Stranger Things latest season came out where the villain molded itself into a black widow to feed on the people of earth, and that while in Oregon last month she asked if I had seen it or watched and suggested it could be something we watch together at the suggestion of her Oregon friends. Man, did I dodge a major bullet. The reason why Meghan suppresses life is that she isn’t adding to it with her own life energy. She is a black widow hiding in her cave while her web mirrors your movements and absorbs and steal your energy until you get tired. This is why she is responsive and also why she lets anything go that detaches from her web because her web is her reality and limit of awareness. Meghan is not aware that she is a back widow or operating as one because she lacks emotional cohesive spatial reference frame. She only is aware of a single dimension of emotional reality which is that she is emotionally alive like a brain without a body but she is unaware of her own body and how her awareness of life translates into movements of that body and what it looks like to other people: all she knows is to search for food but she has no idea what is doing the eating how how she is doing it. She is true dopapthic: single dimension of emotional awareness. Emotionally we are all lacking a spatial cohesive emotional reality and so we exist inside an emotional brain that is unaware of the emotional body, its own movements, its impact on other emotional bodies and the brains within, the emotional reality in which it exists, has no spatial awareness of emotional reality, and is full emotional instinct and no intelligence from the perspective of emotional reality, ie we are emotional bacteria. At some point, I developed an awareness of my emotional body and of emotional space and therefore emotional reality and so I can choose movements separate from instinct and can choose to explore emotional reality rather than create a false one. Intelligence gives awareness of choice and with awareness of choice one can decide why one chooses what they choose. I needed Meghan to mirror off of to see all of this stuff but wow to the fact that she is a black widow. Ouch!! Kira was not a black widow. I don’t know what she is but whatever she is, she is more aware of her contribution to and impact on her emotional body and this naturally lends her to not behaving like a black widow and killing other life forms because she now sees this as detrimental to her ability to explore emotional reality, ie to be locked to a food source and drive to feed rather than a drive to feed for the purpose to explore and those who explore do not seek to destroy that which they are interested in experiencing and so such a person will look for sustainable and fair ways to survive in emotional reality \\n',\n",

Find where I want to be or live or build my emotional home in my emotional cohesive reference frame and then peer into physical reality to project its translation into physical reality, ie turn emotional DOING into physical DOING. This is in contrast to creating something physical from physical doing rather than projecting emotional doing into my physical reference frame to translate into physical doing and seeing what forms. The point is that the creation I can do is only emotional because I am emotional and so creation must take place in emotional reality as emotional doing and then translate into physical doing, rather than the creation existing in the physical world: physical doing from scratch. If you have an emotionally cohesive reference frame then it would be stupid not to explore that world guided by the forces in physical reality compared to exploring the physical world guided by the forces of one’s emotional reality and this is because where you are exploring is where your awareness is and if you are exploring physical reality then you are self abandoning and one only does this if they do not yet have an emotionally cohesive reference frame with which to explore emotional reality. So now that i have an awareness of spatially cohesive emotional reality, I can explore this world taking in as input forces from physical reality to give me an interpretation of perspective on which paths are walkable and which are not. \\n',\n",

It’s fine that I don’t have friends because in my past I have made deep connections with the intent to love as evidenced by being able to create a cohesive emotional reference frame. Find someone who also has had the intent to love others which means the denial of the self when it hurts others as this act of seeing one’s self separate from their trauma is the act of creating new emotional cohesion. It is a waste of time to be with anyone with whom you do not have an intent to love, other than that it’s your choice who to pursue that with base don your needs and desires because when needs and desires are conditioned on preserving the intent to love then you are allowed to get those needs met. It is not required that you only choose those with an intent to love you as long as it is 100% your choice. But if one is seeking chemical and emotional balance like in a romantic relationship then one should at least choose someone who is at least moving toward that intent and ultimately capable of carrying it out. Only here can you build a romantic dynamic capable of expanding each other’s cohesive reality. But if they don’t have the intent to love eventually then a dynamic from their end isn’t built and you are not adding any new orthogonal data to your emotional experience and therefore you end up with the same dimensions. This is separate if your intent to love is as a parent: the way in which you perceive under which conditions a dynamic is considered real determines the data you retrieve. So a kid is not expected to bring emotional balance and this is known so the way in which they operate emotionally is corrected for in your head and brings the dynamic to a balance thereby creating new orthogonal data that is their behavior transformed in your brain with respect to the dynamic expectations to bring it to balance and once it is in balance it becomes emotional data that can be internalized. But if in a romantic dynamic, for example, their own behavior doesn’t balance the dynamic with respect to you sensitivity to perceiving balance, and balance is expected, then you can’t internalize it as emotional data. \\n',\n",

I came forward with the full truth to set myself free, unlike Meghan who came forward when pressured to keep me from breaking free. And I suffered with Dulcie for two months for hours and hours and put the relationship that I grew with you in the dark at risk because it was because of the ground she gave me to stand on that allowed me to connect with you. Meghan used me as ground to safely get her deeper emotional needs met elsewhere and in the dark, instead of denying those needs. The intent to love is a gift of choice to the other. The metaphor for that gift is like laying down on the ground in front of the person as an offer, and if they have truth, if they walk on the path that leads to their true self, then they either say no to the gift and help you back on your feet, or they say yes and lay down beside you. But those who don’t walk that path stand on top of you to make themself a little higher for as long as you will let them—and they call this love because they quite literally are so stupid from trauma that they emotionally think this is how to receive such a gift, by standing on it 😂. I am SO disgusted with myself that I did this to Dulcie. A pure heart is the part of the heart that allows it to lie down but not be stood upon, and naturally knows to not stand on others. A good heart is the part of the heart that allows it to stand but not on another, and naturally knows not to let others stand upon them. Trauma damaged your pure heart so that it would allow being stood upon, and it damaged my good heart so that I would allow myself to stand upon another. And then we met and your damaged pure heart taught my damaged good heart how to choose to be stood upon and therefore how to lie down; and my damaged good heart taught your pure heart how to choose to not be stood upon and therefore how to stand. I allowed you to stand on me by choice given that it was teaching me how to lie down, but Meghan was the first person to stand on me where it wasn’t my choice and gave me a taste of what my trauma did to others. No wonder why Dulcie will never speak to me again. She must think I never learned. Guessing one day Meghan will look back and know what she missed out on too. I practiced lying down with Meghan and learned from it that I can endure the risk. You practiced standing up with Gabe and learned that you can keep yourself safe.

Giving to people is supposed to hurt if you focus on what is leaving your body, but if you focus on the expansion it is causing to your awareness toward your consciousness it is no longer painful but rewarding. Leaving Meghan and keeping it that way was my last act of my intent to love, ie my last act of letting the dynamic break itself rather than me breaking her or breaking myself and when anything is done by the dynamic and not the self, it leads to an increase in awareness of both people’s consciousnesses. The last lesson of love is that the only thing that can break you free of your intent to love in a dynamic is an act of love itself from the perspective of the dynamic not the self. An act of love from the perspective of a self is trauma or survival. An act of love from the perspective of the dynamic are the only acts that carry out the intent to love. Meghan repeatedly acting out of love for herself proves she had no intent to love. She wanted the reflection back from me that she had the intent to love which is why she lied and hid. And when her lie grew bigger it was harder for her to achieve that false reflection, to believe her own desires for her false ego, so she relieved some of the pressure and blended in the makeup by telling me just enough truth to convince herself that her reflection of the intent to love was true. Like all mechanisms bleed out into multiple areas of one’s life, like a cancer that has metastasized, this mechanism ALSO expresses itself in her obsession with her facial appearance and makeup. If she puts on too much makeup (her fakeness and lies become noticeable to her) then she will remove the pressure of this realization by removing makeup, and she leaves just enough on to convince herself that that is her true beauty. If someone says they don’t like her face with makeup she will take offense and punish you for it in silence. I no longer gave her reflections back of her mask and she punished me for it by cheating. So gross. It’s not her fault but still so gross. Maybe my exam isn’t over yet and this processing is the completion. So I can’t contact her until I have fully processed her out of my emotional reference frame, ie her gravity. Once her presence—physically, emotionally, sexually, socially, intellectually, logically, imaginatively—has no gravity in my emotional reference frame then I can decide what to do. If I do not see her as matter in my emotional universe then she can’t have gravity. I give gravity to what I want. I then use the gravity I create from them to move my awareness closer to my consciousness but in a fair way that is constrained to also creating gravity in their world to do the same for them. When I release them from my universe, and me from theirs, I remove their gravity and coast until I come to a stop. It’s like how we use gravity of planets to get to where we want to go in space like a slingshot. Emotional connections used intelligently allow you to manipulate them to get you to a new location of your choosing and when done in love you will also get them to a better location even if they don’t realize it yet. The pain I am feeling are the gforces felt by my awareness as I compete my slingshot maneuver around Meghan and so as I straighten out the pain dissipates and then I can coast until I rest in a new location and can determine the next place I want to be. But the gravitational equation to solve is much easier if I wait to slow down and if I don’t let Meghan back in. I am floating exactly where I need to be floating and like a golf ball I will land in the green and then at that point I can putt my way into the hole with someone. So the pain I am feeling is my ball bouncing toward the green and rolling to a stop. If a true romantic healthy relationship is the putter (ie the type of  club) then the right person is the angle that knocks me (and her) into the hole. Once I stop in the green and therefore am closer to the hole, I can better locate the person who has the right angle relative to the hole. And then I go for it with confidence and we balance each other’s ball movements (commitment to intent to love) such that we sink the hole at the same time: achieve the “you love me” dynamic. \\n',\n",

Her inability to maintain an intent to love though not her fault and just a lack of maturity is what ultimately showed she couldn’t grow a dynamic I needed and I had to actually break up.

Wow!! It wasn’t that I wanted to break up but it revealed our incompatibility in the sense that she had a gap in her connection to truth that my awareness level or lack of in this case, despite being honest, has the range and gravity to push her into an area where she can’t act from truth, ie her true self movements couldn’t be fully converted into her movements of her true self awareness and so enough of it got converted to her trauma awareness or rather the part she keeps hidden.

I’m equally excited to not reunite with Meghan because for starters the universe clearly didn’t want it and therefore it’s not good for her growth nor mine but also because moving on from her is moving toward someone else, a dynamic I would choose over Meghan in a heartbeat as soon as it comes into my awareness and I don’t want to betray my intent to love someone in my future from my past. The person you end up partnering with for life you will realize that every decision you made in the past even before you met came from the intent to love them. Leaving Meghan is an expression of love to my next partner as is allowing myself time to clear all the gravity fields that would interrupt our creation, and this could be including moving and career but we’ll see. \\n',\n",
       " 'Meghan going back to Dave means to me that she didn’t choose to keep my gravity when I left, even for a day lol. Yeah, someone like that can’t intend to love you, only to let you let them use you. Ugh, sucks. But it was worth confirming and assuring closure. Just need to get through this week and finish purging her gravity. Interesting that her absence does not take away her gravity. I guess that proves I had an intent to love her. Staying with Meghan just allows her to put her in a situation where Dave’s gravity outgrows mine in her universe as we decay and she starts being unable to resist cheating on me or behaving in a way that leads to emotional disconnection. She would not be able to resist his gravity and she would act out just like I acted out when I no longer wanted to be with her. I like Meghan but I love a healthy dynamic and she can’t provide that. There are so many other people, hotter, sexier and better at creating than her. Without her being able to create that dynamic, she’s just good not great, no matter her nice her body, face or pussy. You have to honor Meghan’s unconscious choice to go back to Dave. My chemical brain will not orient toward her anymore because the path of Dave at least right now is likely the path that leads her closer to her consciousness, not me. And this is evident by the fact that I see no way of getting closer to my consciousness through an intent to love her so the same is true for her from her intent to love me and so loving each other is impossible. \\n',\n",
       " 'The 3D electromagnetic force might be the translation of the surface kinetics of 4D gravity ie EM is the fabric of our 3D reality. Light is the fabric. When we crash 3D matter together we flatten some of the matter, some of the surface and return it to light. Light is the natural state of all matter. The 4D gravity surface that is flat and takes no shape ie the normal vector of a point of the surface is pointing in the same direction as the direction of the force, translates to the lowest energy state of the 3D universe which has been coined by physicists as zero-point energy and is essentially empty space exposed to no 3D gravitational fields: it’s the pure EM field only. Zero-Point energy is any 3D volume in our 3D universe viewed from the perspective of 4D cohesive space as an area on the surface of a 4D gravitational field, a field that at every point on the surface is expanding equally in all 4D directions, and vector of the direction of this force is the same as the normal vector to that corresponds to the surface area in question. Ugh. Zero-Point Energy is a local area on the surface of a 4D gravitational force whose velocity at every point in that local area is the same as the velocity of the force. This local area corresponds to a volume in 3D space. A zero-point energy space would be completely dark to us, appearing as no energy or mass, because it would be a part of the surface that is not indented and our universe is only cohesive points of indentation. Zero-Point Energy in our 3D universe, in a vacuum, maintains properties of vibrational motion because its normal vector in 4D is angled slightly off from the normal vector of velocity of the 4D surface. So the amount of vibrational energy is proportional to how strong the gravitational field is that it is under. Empty space in a vacuum near heavier gravity will have more vibrational motion than an empty space in a vacuum in a lighter gravity field. The lowest energy state (zero-point energy) of a point in our 3D universe is proportional to the absolute value of the difference or ratio or proportion (I don’t know) in the angles between its normal vector of its corresponding 4D location on the surface of 4D gravity and the directional component of velocity of the 4D surface at that same location on the surface: its the angle difference since all points on the surface have the same velocity and a point on the surface can only differ in the orientation of its normal vector relative to its directional velocity. True zero-point energy can’t be achieved in our observable universe as in zero vibrational motion because that would imply that its normal vector is equal to the direction of its velocity and so isn’t in our visible universe. From wikipedia about zero-point energy: “Many physicists believe that \"the vacuum holds the key to a full understanding of nature”–I agree because it just did lol or so I can hope. From wikipedia on “cosmological constant problem”: “Were the vacuum energy precisely zero, as was once believed, then the expansion of the universe would not accellerate as observed, according to the standard Λ-CDM model”: This holds in my model of reality because this corresponds to the entire universes normal vector being equal to its velocity in 4D cohesive space meaning that either there is no universe to expand because it’s completely flat OR there’s no 4D surface velocity as it’s the 4D surface velocity that translates into acceleration of our 3D universe; if the universe were not accelerating then this would mean that the 4D gravitational field would not be traveling in 4D cohesive space and so while there is a normal vector to the surface there is no velocity vector so the zero-point energy of the universe is not only exactly zero but the universe isn’t even expanding. This means that either the universe is expanding and accelerating or not expanding at all as it is impossible for any universe built in this way not to expand at a constant rate. Our universe may also not be the same in all directions if what created our surface indent was not created from another 4D gravitational force with a velocity 180 degrees from our own in which case our indent may be traveling around the 4D surface like a boat flowing in the currents of the ocean instead of being anchored in place. Our universe may have 4D angular velocity (is that the right word?) and this might have an impact on measurements of total energy and total mass like dark energy or dark matter. Zero-Point Energy if defined as a vacuum without any fields in it then it would be measuring the cosmic background radiation which is the original indentation of full reality that is expanding. 3D Light is the surface of 4D gravity and can only be seen if the surface is bent toward us and so can only be seen if the surface is bent by 3D matter ie gravity. Without 3D matter, the EM field would be invisible: it would be dark energy. Matter, mass, gravity exposes the fabric of reality to us in the form of light. EM as we see it is the evidence of bending of the surface of 4D gravity toward us. This bending of the EM field, the shape is contained inside matter and held there. So matter is the containment or holding pattern of a non-flat, non zero-point energy shape of the 4D surface. This bending of the surface that forms the shape and maintains this shape is what we call 3D matter. Bending that does not maintain its shape releases the EM field that we experience as radiation or light. Things that cause the release of the EM field from matter are high energy matter collisions, ie surface shapes that collide and release flat 4D surface back into our 3D universe. The expansion of the universe is the expansion of the EM field as that is what the fabric of 3D reality is. So 4D gravity is translated into our 3D universe as EM. Light is a flat surface of 4D gravitational force but that does not break local convexity of the part of the 4D surface that defines our 3D universe; in other words, it maintains the normal vector of the surface of our universe in its location on the surface; it does not further bend or flatten the surface or ever obtain a normal vector in the original direction of 4D gravity. So matter holds EM into a shape so that we can experience it as matter, as a shape, but how? Matter is the shape of the surface and the surface making the shape in the EM or energy of the shape ie the energy in matter. E^2 = p^2*c^2 + m^2*c^4. The total energy in matter is equal to the surface area of the specific shape (which is 3D volume???), ie how much of the EM field is contained in what we see as matter. But then how does Einstein’s equality between matter and energy become volume? It looks more like 3D surface area instead of 4D surface area. Is 4D surface area calculated as a square from a 3D reference frame of EM ie it isn’t 3D volume? But that would violate the notion that the 4D surface is 3D cohesive space. This calculation of 4D surface area of a shape would have to take in the curvature of the flat 4D surface of the 4D gravitational field just like the surface area of a portion of the Earth has to take into account the curvature of Earth’s surface or to calculate the total surface area of earth we have to calculate it as a sphere and not as flat. So the surface area of a 3D sphere is 4*pi*r^2 and not length x width like it is for a square. 4D surface area is 2*pi^2*r^3 which would represent the surface area of the FLAT entire 4D gravitational field. But what about a bulge or inverted bulge of a given symmetric curvature? What would be the curvature created by matter and what are the characteristics of what creates 4D surface warping that determine the shape of that warping? It’s complicated because an atom has a symmetry in the 4D surface vectors but not the volume vector meaning that there isn’t a constant increase in mass from the outside of an atom to the inside, or even inside an electron or even a surface of matter of the atom as it’s just electrons flying around in different energy states. There’s an outer ring given an energy state of electrons and then empty space then protons and neutrons separated by space. If we simplify this and think of an atom as a solid ball inside a hollow ball that has some thickness with equal mass as the total sum of electrons then the curvature on the surface caused by an atom would be a 4D hemisphere with the top sliced off and then a much smaller radius 4D hemisphere plopped right in the middle but slightly above the plane that sliced off the top of the bigger 4D hemisphere; and then a smoothing of these hemispheres extended surface based on their pull against each other from each other’s generated gravitational fields, ie you stretch the edges of both 4D hemispheres toward each other and at the strength of their respective gravitation fields (or at relative strengths based on their relative mass). On a 2D surface the outer most surface distortion would look like a torus cut in half horizontally and then in the middle a 3D hemisphere and then a stretching of the inner edge of the half torus and the edge of the hemisphere according to how their gravitational forces add going inward from the torus and outward from the hemisphere. On a 3D surface ie the surface of a 4D sphere, this would be a 4D torus and a 4D hemisphere. c^2 suggests a 2D circle with radius c as if to be a 2D symmetrical slice of 3D cohesive space and then the area of this slice is multiplied by a number m/pi (since the area of the circle is pi x r^2) so E = m/pi*pi*c^2 which creates a 3D cohesive description of matter as cylindrical; volume of a 3D cylinder is h*pi*r^2 so h = m/pi So maybe in 4D cohesive space the 4D energy is approximated by a 3D cylinder made up by multiplying the volume of a 3D sphere by a length but the surface volume of the 4D cylinder–a spherinder–not including the top and bottom surface volume of the lids is the total energy, E. The surface area/volume of a spherinder not including the surface volume of the top and bottom lids is k x 4 x pi x r^2 where k is the height, so we will use G for 4D cohesive calculation of 3D matter enerGy and so G = k x 4 x pi x c^2. But let’s look into E = mc^2 closer. The circle cross section is the amount of energy in a cross section of space that is pushed through the topology of matter. The amount of power in a unit square of EM energy is c in the x direction and c in the y direction to create c^2 but the assumption is that we are taking a radial slice of 3D space which I assume is because 3D symmetry ie a slice of a perfectly uniform 3D cohesive reference frame which implies that the slice must have arbitrary orientation relative to all other slices ie have the same area no matter how the 3D section of space is sliced implies we are slicing a 3D sphere and so the symmetric shape is a 2D circle. The 2D circle represents an infinitesimal slice of 3D mass. And so the starting energy amount for all matter is a single slice of mass of pi x c^2. Now if one assumes that the topology of actual matter is cylindrical in 3D space then the amount of energy stored in matter would be the total number of slices of mass, ie the amount of mass or the volume of the topology or cylinder and this is E = m x pi x c^2. BUT that is not the familiar equation. This suggests that Einsteins topology for how matter is constructed in 3D space as layers of mass creates an energy decay effect and corresponds to E = mc^2 = m/pi x pi x c^2. The volume of a cylinder is V_cylinder = h x pi x r^2 and the volume of a cone is V_cone = 1/3 x h x pi x r^2 = 1/3 x V_cylinder. So E = mc^2 = m/pi x pi x c^2  suggests that Einstein’s assumption for how layers or slices of energy are stacked to create matter is approximately a cone–a linear decay of the radius of the slices. What if we assume a linear decay of the radius of the 3D spherical slices in 4D cohesive space and then we equate mass as height in both 3D and 4D reference frames. The surface volume of a 4D cone has a base term which I’m not sure if I should add and an (annoying) height term of 4/3 x pi x r^2 x (r^2 + h^2)^(1/2). I’m going to remove for a moment the r^2 inside the parentheses (as if to assume h>>r) and write it as 4/3 x h x pi x r^2 and then set h = m and r = c to get 4/3 x m x pi x c^2 ~ 4 x E. But that’s ridiculous because h would never be larger than r because r = c. Ugh, I’m dumb. What am I getting wrong? In the 3D reference frame I’m assuming a unit square of 3D space encompasses c^2 amount of energy. Ok, so Einstein could also be assuming that slices of energy stack into a 3D cube and the height of the cube is the mass, m, so E = m x c^2. Well that seems wrong because why would you think that matter is constructed from slicing a cube and not a sphere? If it’s a sphere and we assume matter is built from stacking slices of circles then E = m x pi x c^2. If we assume linear decay of energy for each additionally added slice then it would be a cone E = m/3 x pi^c^2 or in Einsteins square slice a pyramid E=m/3 x c^2. Are Einstein’s energy calculations off by a factor of pi? Nope. They are dead on accurate. E=mc^2 is relativistic mass meaning mass measured relative to a fixed reference frame that is considered at rest. If the mass is considered not to be moving in a given reference frame then its equivalent to the rest mass. And I’m curious in total energy of 3D matter at rest as being the surface volume of surface symmetrical shapes on the surface of a 4D sphere. What surface volume equals E=m x c^2? Actually E =mc^2 corresponds to a slice of a hyperrectangle in 4D cohesive space. Since experiments validate E=mc^2 with high precision, then apparently the energy held together by 3D matter is equal to a slice of a 4D hyper-rectangle. I guess the slice makes total since rather than surface area since a piece of matter is a piece of the 4D surface which is a 3D object and the energy it contains is its 3D volume if at rest. Why would matter be built from stacking square slices of the EM field and not circular? A square slice seems to have non-uniform 3D cohesion which seems like a dumb thing to use as a measurement of rest mass since a rest mass reference frame should be in a vacuum which means no gravitational fields but its own which means all orientations of its reference frame in which it is measuring its own gravitational force should be indistinguishable from one another. By making the slice a square it’s assuming that a square slice adjusts for some other field such that if the matter is measuring its gravitational field at the surface of the cube even at its corners (which are further away than the sides) the measurement is the same. But if there are no other fields then the measurement of its gravitational field at any length should be the same no matter which direction of 3D space it picks and this implies 3D matter should measure its energy as the volume of a 4D slice that produces a 3D sphere. Maybe E=mc^2 is inadvertently correcting for the curvature of the 4D surface of the 4D gravitational field on which our 3D universe is printed. And the illogical use of a square slice of the EM field instead of a circular slice, when corrected and interpreted with the knowledge that E=mc^2 has been verified in experiments might therefore suggest a curvature to our universe. If the curvature of our universe is equivalent to the surface of a 4D sphere then a slice of the fabric of our universe by a square plane with length and width = c and therefore surface area c^2 creates a spherical cap cut out of a piece of our universe ie an infinitesimal piece of the EM field with a surface area of 2 x pi x h x c. Then the proposal is that E = 2 x pi x h x c. Now taking into consideration that experiments have confirmed that E=mc^2 and that our experimental measures of m are absorbing the effects of the curvature of the universe ie we are assuming the curvature of the universe is inherent to the matter and so it adds to the mass suggests that the square surface area is still the right multiplicative energy factor of a flat universe. And so to remove the impact of the curvature of the universe on our measurements of the mass of matter it must be that the surface area of the spherical cap which now contains the curvature of the universe instead of it being contained in the mass equals the surface area of the square slice assumed by a flat universe. This implies that 2 x pi x h x c = c^2 which implies 2 x pi x h = c which implies that h = c/(2 x pi). This means that the degree to which our universe is curved and not flat is such that any slice of our universe made by a 2-D plane with length=width=c creates a distance from the plane to the universe by height c/(2 x pi). So E = m x c^2 = ?? The point is that the height is equal to c/(2 x pi). Does this height imply a speed of light such that if another universe had height k/(2 x pi) that it light speed in that universe would be k? What does this imply about the error in our measurements of mass? What’s the correct mass when you correct for the universes shape? This might be related to the cosmological constant problem or dark energy problem. The curvature of the universe might cause an anti-gravity reaction from our perspective but is the result of our universe being indented relative to the smooth 4D spherical surface. Somehow when we calculate the energy of visible mass we might actually be missing the extra energy added by the curvature of the universe and so we are estimating less energy than there is, hence dark energy. Dark energy is thought to create a repulsive force connected to the acceleration of the expansion of the universe but the extra energy may be the energy from 4D gravity imparting more energy to our universe because of its shape not being flat or not facing parallel to its velocity in 4D cohesive space. The center of curvature therefore exists in 4D cohesive space and if our 3D universe is uniform then the center of the universe would have the least energy (or most energy) ie the point whose normal vector in 4D is parallel to its 4D velocity. The extra energy in the universe might be how much of 4D gravity energy is flowing in the surface direction ie the degree to which the normal vector in 4D is different from its 4D velocity. The degree to which 3D gravity is created is the difference of the normal vector to the velocity vector. If this is a big different then we are converting 4D momentum into more 3D mass and if this is small we are converting 4D momentum into more 3D momentum. If there is no different in the vectors then there can be no 3D universe at all, neither as 3D mass or 3D momentum. This means that the 3D universe is a curve relative to its velocity vectors. This also means that the EM field has a background, very tiny bit of 3D mass and therefore gives off gravity–the quantum vacuum energy. But we normalize our measurements of 3D mass and momentum against the EM background such that we estimate light to be 0 mass and this is true from the perspective of 3D reference frame. We have no choice but to measure light as 0 mass but from a 4D reference frame light has a tiny bit of 3D mass and mostly 3D momentum but when we only measure its momentum and therefore do not add its mass to our total calculation of energy in the universe and this could be the source of dark energy. This also implies that our measurement of the speed limit of 3D reality, c, is actually less than the speed limit we would measure for 3D reality from a 4D reference frame since light contains a little 3D mass. At the center of the universe there is no difference. The center of the universe may be the point in the universe with the least or most dark energy, ie the most or least expansion. The energy of 4D gravity is Also this theory of the surface of 4D gravity being impacted aligns with the observation that the Big Bang happened everywhere in the universe equally. Also the answer to the question “What is the universe expanding into? What is outside the universe?” that there is nothing outside the universe because the universe is everything then it’s part of the universe, and the other one that a 3D universe is perfectly consistent ie that even if there is something outside of it the knowledge of that is not required are all wrong. First, the “if the universe is everything then if something were outside of it, it would be part of the universe” is wrong because this assumes a 3D cohesive reference frame of reality. They are right that if the universe is the definition of 3D spatial cohesion then 3D construct (nothingness or not) that lies outside of the universe would be part of the universe, but this says nothing of 4D spatial objects. A 4D spatial object does not fully if at all need to live inside a 3D spatially cohesive universe so 4D or higher dimensional objects that therefore live in a higher dimensional spatial cohesion can exist outside a 3D universe. In fact, multiple 3D disconnected universes can exist from within a 4D cohesive reference frame but not within a given universes 3D spatial reference frame. For example, if you define the universe to be the surface of the earth then this defines a 2D reference frame and there can’t be anything on the earths surface that isn’t part of the earths surface by definition of the reference frame. But there are several planets in the universe all with 2D surfaces so when we view reality from 3D cohesion there are several 2D universes. The second answer that there is no consequence if our 3D universe exists in multiple dimensions because the universe can exist on its own is wrong because this assumes that our 3D universe isn’t impacted by higher dimensional cohesion. The correct implication of this answer is that from a given 3D cohesive REFERENCE FRAME it doesn’t matter, meaning that if we view the universe from a 3D cohesive framework then whatever impacts 4D cohesive reality has on our reference frame will either be invisible to us because they have no consequence or we will just interpret them from a 3D perspective. But this strategy is like peeking into a higher dimension through its measured effects from a 3D perspective through integration, rather than finding the exact equation of the parent function and taking a derivative and therefore getting a better view of reality. An example is Time. But this isn’t the perfect analogy. The arbitrary constant created from integration is like a 4D object that doesn’t impact our universe so who cares. But in actuality there are very hard to see impacts on our 3D universe: dark energy, acceleration of expansion, universe curvature, cosmological constant, speed of light value, quantum phenomena, such that the parent function does have a very small term that does not differentiate to zero but it’s very hard to nail it down and so the wrong answer is saying that it’s nearly constant so who cares but nearly is a matter of perspective and if we view our 3D world from a more cohesive structure of reality we will interpret the impacts in a way that is actually more accurate and lead to a greater understanding. The key to calculating the total mass and energy in the universe is to reformulate Einstein’s verified formula from the geometry that my theory implies. Meaning, assume that Einstein’s equations are based off of assuming that the velocity of an empty point in our space in 4D is its normal vector. This should result in the cosmological constant, except that it wouldn’t be constant and would point to a center of the universe, or maybe it’s the radius of our universe measured from its center of curvature so that the cosmological constant is constant. A surface that can’t see another point on its surface from another point on its surface that doesn’t have a spatial dimension in the direction normal to that point in its 3D reference frame and that isn’t 3D cohesive is a sphere. Such a reality has no time and no cohesion in a 3D reality, meaning all reference frames have a perfectly flattened time and therefore is a static 3D environment but it isn’t cohesive either with any other point’s 3D cohesive reference frame and so doesn’t technically exist as 3D because nothing in 3D can reflect that it does; it’s just a point in 3D. If it’s flat (ie a plane or cylinder) though then then we can see cohesion in reality but we have no need for time, ie this is a static 3D cohesive environment with the time dimension fully collapsed within it. The only way for our reality to exist is if our existence lives on a curvature that is pointed inward, that for instance has the same center of curvature. Then the normal vector in 4D to each point of this surface is pointed to the same center of curvature which is always finite (also proving that our universe is finite) and is not in the same direction as its velocity in 4D then our 3D reality is spatially cohesive and the 4D spatial dimension is not fully collapsed in our 3D spatially cohesive reference frame implying that the cohesion of our awareness of physical reality includes a 4th dimension we call Time which our increased intelligence is capable of recognizing but not from a 4D spatially cohesive reality–only through cohesive awareness and so Time appears to be separate from our spatially cohesive reference frame which is therefore 3D. A blackhole is when gravity creates a timeless 3D point not cohesive with the rest of reality, ie it shifts its 4D normal vector of its point toward the direction of its 4D velocity. All gravity offsets a points normal vector away from the vector leading to the center of curvature and toward its 4D velocity vector. Gravity changes matter’s center of curvature toward the larger mass’s. Gravity brings points on the surface (EM) together as if one point and creates the illusion of matter that contains energy. The curvature also is the “dark matter” that keeps galaxies together. The 3D energy that is not contained in matter that we consider to be 0 mass at any point in reality is the angle or length of the vector that leads to the universal center of curvature. The percentage that a points normal vector shifts toward the vector that loses Time as a spatial dimension is our measurement of 3D cohesive mass. This vector vibrates creating the quantum vacuum phenomena. So the difference in length to the center of curvature and thee normal vector up to the point on the surface of the sphere where it used to be is the amount of mass. So a blackhole is actually stretching that point back to the surface of the sphere suggesting that mass does not distort reality like a bowling ball does to the mattress but like pinching a blanket a lifting up. Matter creates hills of EM, not pits. The more points that are in its 3D cohesive reality the more gravity it has because it’s combining the mass of a single point of EM. EM is a 3D reference frame of a single point. Gravity is a 3D reference frame that contains more than one point and this is what we call matter. Light is energy traveling through a 3D reference frame that contains a single point which is due to its 0 mass but its normal vector will be that of the gravitation field that it is at and if there is one then we can measure its energy as positive. A reference frame that has mass necessarily contains more than one point in its reference frame. But light has mass but we say it has 0 mass because mass is relative to the lowest mass. The reason it does’t have mass is due to the curvature of the earth. What defines a single point is determined by the curvature locally and it’s that definition that we equate to 0 mass. It would of course make sense that even mass is a relative quantity. The true size of a single point reference frame, true 0 3D mass, is the 3D reference frame of a single point on the surface of a 4D sphere. Curvature of this surface combines 3D reference frames of the spherical surface to combine when this surface is indented like a crater. So this reference frame by definition has 3D mass but this minimally combined reference frame is our definition of 0 mass or pure energy, when in fact it has mass given it has more than one combined 3D reference frame compared to a 4D spherical surface. And of course it has mass or else how could we live in a 3D cohesive reality otherwise. Since matter is a hill not a pit then maybe matter is created by the opposite direction of a vector shift ie away from the surface of the sphere since the surface of the sphere is a 0 mass point. 0 mass is anything that doesn’t further invert the surface into a hill or pit. Wait so maybe mass is a pit not a hill since going to the surface is 0 mass. Infinite mass is a 90 degree angle between the normal vector of that point if on a 4D sphere and its actual normal vector. So infinite mass would tear a hole in the fabric of space because for a point to be 90 degrees in the center of a blackhole for instance there would have to be no center, ie a hole. The blackhole is trying a combination of a massive amount of 3D reference frames all compressed into one reference frame of a single point. Matter allows the combination of single point reference frames to behave like a single point ie a particle. A particle is just a reference frame of multiple EM points viewed as a single point reference frame. The curvature of the surface is what keeps matter intact, what keeps the reference frames combined, and this propagates outward. If all non matter non-gravity points in the universe have the same size reference frames then the curvature of the universe would be calculated proportional to the amount of dark matter gravity. The reason why the EM field doesn’t appear to have matter is because it matches the minimal curvature of the universe (zero-point energy) and that value gives the contrast against which matter comes into our awareness, but it is matter. This means the stretching of the universe might be stretching out what once was matter but now doesn’t have enough gravity to coalesce into matter but does coalesce to an extent through vibrational energy in a quantum vacuum but should be less frequent over time? Is this what decay is? But 0 mass has gravity which is to keep the curvature of space ie not go back to a spherical surface shape. So the EM field maintains its curvature through its gravity which is how galaxies stay together despite having less positive mass. Galaxies have enough mass to stay together when you calculate it from a 4D spatially cohesive reference frame but not from a 3D cohesive reference frame because the height of the spatial 4th dimension we call 0 3D mass from a 3D reference frame when in fact it has 4D cohesive mass that changes the behavior of what we call 3D spatially cohesive matter because that matter actually exists in 4D cohesive space. So dark matter will be light matter when we measure mass from a 4D cohesive reference frame, not a 3D cohesive reference frame. So how do we measure 3D mass from a 4D reference frame? We take curvature into account. How do I calculate the curvature? The radius of a circle determines its curvature size. If it’s small then the curvature is large. If it’s small then it’s huge. A plane has an infinite radius and so the curvature is 0. If the radius is 0 then the curvature is infinite. If the 4D sphere we are on is expanding outward then so is its radius and the curvature is going to zero. Are we on the inside of this sphere’s surface expanding? And the Big Bang was just the start of this sphere expanding? That would suggest we could walk through 3D reality and end up where we started no matter what direction we walk as long as we go straight. This would also suggest that we are the only universe in this construct. In the beginning of Time, reference frames were highly condensed and so from the inside perspective all 3D reference frames were condensed into one and represents the beginning single mass of the Big Bang. OMG, this conclusion aligns with current physics, but it wasn’t a signal mass, it was a single 3D cohesive reference frame of reference frames and the expansion is the release of reference frames like starting a game of pool. But from a 4D cohesive framework the force isn’t going outward in 3D like it appears, the force driving our expansion is going outward in 4D cohesive space which translates into our 3D reference frame as accurately as possible as outward expansion in 3D. But actually it’s the opposite side of the universe that is expanding. The radius to the 4D center is the degree to which 4D Time is a spatial dimension in our 3D reference frame. The sphere expanding means that radius is approaching infinity and so a single point on the inner surface of the 4D sphere will have a 4D reference frame with an ever shrinking spatial Time dimension and a flattened 3D spatial cohesive reference frame meaning that all reference frames are approaching a reality in which Time is completely orthogonal to 3D cohesive space and therefore 3D is static and no longer affected by Time. This is in the limit so it will never be achieved but Time will slow down in our 3D reference frame (the 4D spatial dimension will shrink) as a response to compensate for the inner surface growing larger, as if Time space is being converted to 3D space causing the expansion of the universe. After all, is 3D gravity an outward force at all or a conversion of the third dimension of a given orientation of 3D reality into 2D space. So while it may appear like we are being stretched and expanded, we are actually being pumped with space as 4D gravity expands. Gravity forces 3D reference frames to adjust their orientation from perfect uniformity and flatness to non-uniformity and curvature. But flatness and uniformity is relative to the curvature of the universe, of the EM field. Even a uniform reference frame with a balance of gravity everywhere, kind of like the sun, is not fully cohesive with itself because gravity bends the dimensions. A uniformly oriented cohesive reference frame can make any arbitrary point its center. Maybe an object in motion stays in motion without an outside force changing it is wrong! Maybe it actually would come to a stop except for the curvature of the 3D universe. Staying in motion requires no loss of energy but matter that is traveling is bending the EM field and so is losing energy. Light does not bend EM and so is not losing energy and so stays in motion always at the same speed instantaneously. So matter adjusting the uniformity and/or flatness of a reference frame takes energy and the only energy in the universe is EM. Maybe light is what the EM field looks like when traveling through your own reference frame and gravity is what the EM field looks like when you are traveling through another’s reference frame. This is how it works for emotion. For example, if you are viewing someone from the perspective that they are just passing through you feel no effect from them: they are invisible in terms of pull but you do see them. This is the definition of energy: no pull but you experience it traveling through your reference frame. But if we view someone that we want to stay stable in our reference frame then we orient to them to keep them in it and give them mass in our reference frame which creates pull. Gravity and mass seems to be the effect of choosing to view EM holding a spot in our reference frame rather than passing through. In other words, matter and mass is our reference frame continuously orienting itself to another reference frame such that it holds a consistent spot, like if a cute person walks by you will turn your head to keep them in the exact same spot in your reference frame so that you can create contrasts from it. This implies something pretty insane: that all of the universe is light or energy ie EM field and its our brains that stabilize the energy’s position to create the appearance of matter for the purpose of creating a contrast relative to the background EM field. In other words, any existence without this ability in their reference frame only sees light. In order for our reference frame to view matter instead of light, we have to only feel gravity. So gravity is the result of viewing the EM field as matter instead of light. Our brains interpret the increased distance that the EM field must travel relative to itself against the background shape of the universe as matter with gravity. In other words, our brains 3D reference frame is not a full cohesive reference frame and so when the EM field clumps and distorts 4D cohesive space our brain is forced to split the light signal into 2 reference frames: a single dimension of Time, and a 3D spatially cohesive reference frame. Light has a speed that our reference frame can’t stabilize into matter; it’s like trying to stabilize a car passing by going 200mph such that it isn’t moving in your reference frame and you can read its license plate. The speed of light is actually the speed at which our brain’s reference frame can’t stabilize the EM field. Clumped EM or matter can be (incorrectly) thought of as energy traveling at a slower speed through our reference frame. More accurately, the EM field is radiating at a slower speed in our reference frame meaning that its traveling slower in time(?). But 4D spatially cohesive reference frames view our universe’s matter as 4D light. Our 3D spatially cohesive reference frames split 4D energy into matter and gravity/mass. Matter occupies our 3D spatially cohesive reference frame and mass or gravity occupies our Time reference frame. Light is energy that is fully converted into our 3D reference frame and therefore has no mass and therefore imparts to gravity and therefore experiences no time from our perspective. 3D light is 4D energy flowing perpendicular to the normal vector of any point on the surface of our 3D universe viewed from a 4D spatially cohesive reference frame. So gravity is our interpretation of the vector component of 4D energy in the direction normal to the surface of the universe viewed from a 4D cohesive reference frame. This proves we live in a 4D spatially cohesive reference frame. Light is what occurs when the 4D dimensional vector components representing the 3D spatial directions of our universe are all 0 implying that the 4D energy is oriented normal to each point it travels through. BUT the reason why can see energy perpendicular to the surface of our universe is because the universe is curved inward and so its normal vector of its reference frame and the normal vector of our reference frame is less than 90 degrees. This is why we can only view light from a distance and therefore doesn’t impact us gravitationally (and might also be a part of the explanation of why neutrinos go right through us) because as soon as the energy shares the reference frame of any particle of our body the energy is perpendicular and so imposes no 3D gravity and no 3D mass because our reference frame can no longer view it in 3D cohesive space. But it still imposes an energetic effect in our Time dimension which means that it imposes Time gravity and Time mass at every point on us and so it pushes our 3D existence more in the direction of Time, ie it adds to the 4th dimension of the vector component that fully describes our existence, ie it is stretching out the 4th dimension our spatial reference frame and so Time is becoming more spatial leading to increased awareness of self through the effect of making our 3D cohesive reference frame which is just a very non-uniform 4D spatial cohesive reference frame more uniformly cohesive. It also creates radiation and mutations etc. Neutrinos might be inverted EM meaning energy flowing fully in 4D but the opposite direction of what we call light. This means that the expansion of the universe at every point might actually be 4D energy passing through our 3D universe normal to the point in our 3D universe’s surface that it passes through and adds EM energy to the 4th component of the 4D dimensional vector that describes each point in space (that we call Time) and therefore more EM fabric to our universe which is the equivalent to increasing the position of each point in 3D space in the 4D direction (ie normal to 3D) and therefore looks like expansion to us because it’s an increase. This added energy then settles back into the background curvature or zero-point energy state which is what actually creates the expansion and essentially adds a new 3D point to reality. But because there is inward curvature to the universe we do not share the same reference frame or 3D orientation as other points in space and so points that are further away are more likely to have a drastically different orientation to 3D reality and so part of the increase to their 4th vector component looks to us like it was partially added to their 3D vector components because we view this added energy not from its orientation but from ours. This is why the expansion of the universe has a color change effect especially for further away galaxies. Points that are closer to us are more likely to share our orientation of what the 4th vector component is especially if there is gravity forcing such an orientation such that we don’t view the person next to us as expanding away from us because our 3D vector components haven’t changed relative to each other because we share the same orientation of what 3D and what Time is. This means that we are viewing far away galaxies’ movement through Time as movement through space!! What it perceives as Time passing, we perceive it as traveling through space ie away from us. This further gives evidence that Time is a space dimension that is cohesive with 3D or else we couldn’t automatically orient our reference frame to interpret its movement through time as 3D spatial movement. All we are doing is changing the orientation of the 4 spatial axes of cohesive reality of the far away galaxy to our own and they are different in all direction because the universe has curvature in 4D cohesive reality, yet we are only consciously aware of 3 cohesive space dimensions and so we interpret the movement through time as movement though space. We don’t view each other traveling through space as our 4th vector component increases because we share the same orientation of 4D realty. So we are expanding together through both time and space. People or events in our past just have a different 4th vector component and a different orientation! A natural death is when our unique 3D vectors of awareness in our brain flatten out with respect to their 4th vector component. And ironically but fittingly a blackhole is what occurs when the 4th dimensional vector component of a point in our 3D universe approaches 0, ie 4D energy is completely oriented in a direction parallel to 3D cohesive space to the limit that all 4D energy is converted to matter and therefore 3D gravity. It’s black to us because it’s normal vector is too close to parallel to 3D cohesive reality in all reference frames and we can’t detect light bent that close to parallel; though depending on the reference frame the light that does reflect off say a small blackhole might be slightly different. Light is the EM field bending toward us and a blackhole bends it away. Blackholes create an orientation shared by all reference frames in the universe (at least in the limit). This means that our reference frame that we try to project onto blackholes far in the distance is oriented similar to the blackhole so Time passing for the blackhole will not be converted to light that we see and so won’t create the same redshift and our estimate of where blackholes are, are inferred by the red shift of the surrounding light. How does expansion affect blackholes? 4D energy flow isn’t affected by 3D gravity. 4D energy is emanating from a 4D core in all directions and our 3D universe is the inside of the surface of a 4D sphere being impacted from the inside, perpindicular to the surface of the sphere and therefore normal to all points in 3D space. Because the expansion of the universe leads to more EM being added to 3D space and stretches out according to the orientation of the point so if that point is in a blackhole then it doesn’t permeate or flow outward or escape the blackhole and so the blackhole is by definition adding EM into its shape AS MASS and not Time ie expansion. So blackholes increase in mass instead of expanding in space. Gravity is just that part of 4D energy oriented parallel to the surface of the universe. EM energy, light specifically, is just 4D energy oriented normal to the surface of the universe but seen from a reference frame where that normal vector is pointed toward and when light reaches your eye it becomes normal to your reference frame so that you are able to see it externally in reality rather than blind your reference frame. If two people are traveling toward each other at half the speed of light then the other will appear as light to them. So there appears to be a 4D object putting energy normal to our surface and in the direction of Time at every point and causing expansion. And if it’s 4D energy then it must be a 4D star pumping EM into our universe but not burning it to a crisp because it has had time to get distance. This means when the 4D star has used up its fuel the star might behave like our 3D stars and collapse into a 4D blackhole or blow up like a supernova. This is a stupid concept I think but maybe 4D energy doesn’t behave like 3D energy. Maybe 4D energy is balanced by Time and not to destructive kind of like how Helium is balanced by having an extra proton and so more stable. Talk about symmetry of positive mass.

Girls I would be with were physically with me but we were separate emotionally. I kept getting back the same signal and finally learned to decode it: I am alone.

Truth starts at the core and exposes the darkness from the inside out so that it loses its center and therefore gets the worst thing out first. Meghan felt convinced that she wanted me back so she must have traveled further down the path with Dave and realized he’s a dead end. She must have got something more out of her system and I think something physical happened or happened again. If this is the case, she needs to understand that I enjoy being cucked even in retrospect but I can’t be cucked until she secures the leaks in communication. I have only gotten angry at her lack of communication, never about what she communicated. She needs to give me my choice back or lose me forever. I can’t place her in my emotional reality even as a friend if she is going to claim my property as her own. Kira is only allowed to do this because a) she has been honest with tough things, b) she does apologize, and c) she dealt with the fullness of my disease and not by choice. I took away her choice so I have allowed her to take away mine at ever decreasing degrees. When I chose to date Meghan, I gave her her choice to even take away mine. That’s the risk we take when we intend to love: that we allow the other even the choice to take away our choice because one cannot be fully chosen (which is the only kind of chosen) if they do not gift the other the fullness of choice, even the choice to take away choice. I have never taken away her choice but she seems to not value that gift because she cannot give it and so isn’t scared of it. And that’s why Dave perhaps is a good fit for her because he will gladly take away her choice to choose that gives her the ability to justify her hiding from him. It also feels like meghan hasn’t told the whole truth because she doesn’t seem to be set free. There isn’t a release of the bandaid being ripped off. She’s slowly ripping it off and trying to get away with not having to rip it off. She needs to take some time and search for the center of her behavior (internal and external) that she has hidden from me and start there and just rip it off. It will feel so much better and it exercises power of one’s instincts to hide, and power of instinct is called intelligence and intelligence is movement and movement is life. By not starting at the center you are bargaining with the disease, not fighting it. And I am at my limit for how much more anxiety I can take from this and I will have to let her go if she can’t rip the bandaid off and just put this behind us. If she can’t tell me then she needs to at least say “I’m sorry but I can’t tell you everything” and let us part in confidence that we are both making the right decision rather than forcing me to purge her because I keep reacting to the disease she is hiding and thinking that that is the same thing as her telling me she can’t tell me everything and then us parting ways. She has to realize that there is pain I have to carry with me not knowing and having to guess. Even if the guess is right, it causes me anxiety to never know and it’s so unfair. It’s clear to me that she can’t tell me everything cause she wen right back to him which means she creates more gravity than I thought either internally (she really likes him way more than she let off) or externally (she fucked him or something else), and the fact that she knows she wants me now, and the fact that she didn’t reach out to tell me that. There’s more she won’t tell me. Ugh!!! Meghan!! When will you get it?!! It’s hilarious! Someday you will feel a tug wishing I was in your life and I won’t ever let you back in, not even a hello. I will avoid you forever.  Tell her soon that at some point you want to reach out to Rose and that you’re attracted right now to the idea of dating someone new but that you don’t want to do online dating and so Rose is a nice balance, and that you are attracted to her for real dating. Don’t overweight toward the Dave situation. She also has no time for you and literally makes no time. She probably said things to him like “you’re really hot. I’m really attracted to you. I really like you too. I think you’re a great guy. Etc.” I need to know all the things she said. She reminds me of my mom in that my mom will lie and lie as long as she can’t get caught. Meghan feels like that when she is telling the truth: like she is forced to or it’s in her best interest to alleviate my concerns so that she can get me back. It doesn’t sound like when she finally reveals the truth that she feels relieved and released from her lack of choice over telling the truth. \\n',\n",

It’s a skill that I am grateful for but I use it cautiously. The truth is meghan doesn’t fight for me just like zannie didn’t. These people don’t know how to fight or what they are fighting for. Meghan will clearly start dating Dave and has real feelings for him considering she has expressed in the past it’s all disease but now can’t say for sure that she wouldn’t date him. So strange. There has been no one in my life, except for complete strangers, that I would not be able to definitively say if I would date them or not in a real way. She is clearly attracted to him and that attraction was necessarily made from the major current contrasts in her life: me. She is going to go back to him because being around me just creates a more clear picture that she is attracted to him. She knows she can save him for later if we don’t work but me she can only have now. \\n',\n",
       " 'I want Meghan back. I want us to be in love and stay together. If I had my choice that would be it. But there’s no reason to believe it can happen. I don’t believe that it’s just disease that attracts her to him. I think that’s what let it get so far but I think she opened up Pandora’s box and now she realizes it’s not just disease. And this goes back to her saying to him “I feel like I messed up any real chance we have at a relationship because of the way it started” which isn’t true at all. She’s going to see him every week and feel that gravity every week. I feel like she puts him on pause but never actually gets rid of her real attraction. I need to see that Meghan can actually open up about things she is inclined to hide or has hidden as opposed to always being asked and not from the perspective of needing to be an honest or “good” person but because she is choosing our dynamic’s health over her attraction to another person. Meghan can continue to explore this attraction even in our dynamic as long as it’s done within our dynamic. Kira’s suggestion is to let Meghan loose and see what she does with this guy because I’m not going to be able to trust Meghan week after week as a committed romantic dynamic because she has shown an ability and choice to hide from me and never shown me otherwise. Does Meghan actually believe she can commit romantically or does she feel like she needs to see how her body and mind behaves over time around Dave when left to her own devices without our dynamic painting that attraction as disease? Maybe she really does want to explore something with him but right now the big contrast says it’s disease. Kira said she needs to be really clear with you and make you understand what she knows and what she questions in regards to both Dave, you and herself, and then demonstrate it and make choices that aren’t pressured by you or responsibilities to a dynamic. If she loves you and wants to truly express that then she will make the choices she needs to to clear a path back to you and that may include not having sex or being romantic with you and instead going toward Dave just to get it out of her system so that she has the knowledge that he’s a short term need so that he doesn’t maintain an attachment to her. She needs to be honest with herself and you about how she has communicated her attraction to him, like what does he think she thinks, and Also, my inability to let go of Meghan without purging is a result of not having community to meet deeper needs that I want her to meet despite my true desire not to be with her. She needs to make it clear why she is attracted to me versus him and him versus me. She needs to make it clear where I win and where he wins. She brought this into our dynamic so she needs to share the contrasts she has been freely making between him and I. It is so mean to use what I give her to create contrasts with someone else, make language with someone else. I should have a right to know how my choices in our dynamic are going to be used. I really feel like she isn’t putting her all in this. She isn’t putting herself at the same emotional risk that I am despite putting us in this situation where I am now doing ALL OF THE WORK AND BUILDING. I know how this is going to end, just like Dulcie. Meghan opened up a infinitely deep well of insecurity just like Zannie did and then I let exposed that well until Zannie broke up with me and I was devastated. I was better off just realizing this and calling it quits forever on my terms instead of having to do all the emotional work to walk away from this well through a painful purging process. I can feel Meghan drowning and she really drowned herself. Once she believes there is no way she can get me to love her again, she will leave me and go straight for Dave and feel good about leaving me like she did to E. Gross. \\n',\n",

Maybe I should balance her darkness with my own which is 1000 times worse. She doesn’t deserve my light. This is also me being angry that she isn’t expressing sexual attraction toward me or emotional attraction but Dave she gives it to freely. Dave knows he’s next on line and that her and I are over. Of course he’s going to play it safe to keep her hooked for later. And that was the attraction she felt when he took accountability. He kept his claws in her and he knew it. He has nothing to lose by playing it safe cause he has.L nothing to lose yet. Just wait Meghan when he does. She’s an idiot but it’s apparently what she needs. Maybe best to meet her at improper now. My anxiety comes from feeling like I’m the one that has to reach out for her and she isn’t doing shit. So maybe I need to let her. Open relationship? Does she realize that if one person gets a taste of me and is a matured person and there’s physical and sexual attraction on both sides that they won’t let go and neither would I? I don’t get why she isn’t anxious about that. It’s like she doesn’t understand my actual value. My chemical brain hates her for me. Literally repels my energy away from her. By the way she can’t say she would never date him, she will always wonder about a relationship with him and that gravity will grow as her and I fail to gain depth in our connection. She’s an echo of an emotional person. It’s like she emotionally suicided herself a long time ago. I don’t think she will ever realize what she lost because she doesn’t have a life to know it. I always had life in me. I struggled for what was right and good. Women would kill to have me, to give me quality time. I have no idea why Meghan wants me or is attracted to me. I don’t get it. It makes no sense. People don’t have power over me, they do exactly as I direct and I directed her to Dave to reveal her true awareness.

I also don’t want to poison my new life with Meghan’s disease of lying. Attraction to guilt isn’t what I’m worried about. I can’t reconcile a true emotional attraction to me and her continued behavior of lying and going toward Dave and not being clear about her attraction to him or being accountable. She likes him. He gives her the fucked up environment she needs. She gets control over the validation she needs just like I did with Kira. How could she be attracted to him manipulating her? Because she is manipulating him! Gross! It’s like “Hey! Do you want to manipulate each other and call it love?”. Kira and I actually loved each other and fought for it, hard.

She wants to pull away from Dave not because she isn’t attracted to him and wants me but because she wants there to be space between her and him so that it can start healthy. She will recreate the pattern of dating me so that that gives her easy space away from something with Dave and then wreck our relationship when she’s ready to or let me get tired of her and then enough time will have passed such that the stench of the way it initially started with Dave will not be detectable and she can get what she wanted which was a clean view of her attraction with Dave so that she can get from it exactly what she wants.

If your desire is to seek truth then it’s to seek yourself and that is enough to generate an emotion of “wait, that’s not me” and feel disappointed that you don’t have control over reality switching and therefore it isn’t you. This disappointment creates a bridge between two realities and slowly pulls them together each time you reality switch. You don’t have to feel bad for hurting someone, you only have to feel bad that you are not your full self yet and that’s enough so you can be honest with your partner and still be in a healthy partnership. Over time these two realities will be pulled together and made cohesive and you will then be free to choose what you do in these scenarios rather than fearful of getting near them. This extra cohesion adds a new dimension of space which exponentially increases the emotional room you have.

       " 'BTW, the reason you gave me for why I struggle to make a clear choice and find a middle ground between purging someone and staying in the relationship was life altering advice 🤯🤯🤯. Like you said, I don’t have sources like friends to emotionally counterbalance the gravity from the romantic dynamic that I am trying to create distance from. It’s the same concept as if you’re floating in space: if you want to get out of the gravitational pull of a planet (a romantic dynamic) you either have to make the planet disappear (purge) OR you have to place other planets around you—e.g. emotional dynamics with friends—to add gravity that counterbalances the romantic dynamic gravity. I have been asking this question over and over again for years and literally having NO answers: “what are the emotional, non-selfish, non-taking, non-sacrificing reasons for putting in emotional energy for building friendships that aren’t deep like a romantic relationship?” And yesterday you input one of those answers (I’m sure there are many) DIRECTLY into my emotional brain: to mutually develop a friendship dynamic with someone such that the dynamic’s emotional gravity provides a counterbalance of gravity simultaneously in both people’s larger emotional reality that gives each more precise control over their emotional movements/decisions/growth/options/vision/paths/position. You may have spoken words but it’s their source that gives them the power to penetrate into the emotional brain and build the missing connections: true empathy. And I think this is important to spell out to you so that you know why people are amazed at you (and me) when helping them. Empathy is intelligence and intelligence comes from choice made from full awareness in the emotional world, period. Empaths that automatically feel someone’s pain don’t have empathy because they don’t have choice. In some situations feeling the full extent of someone’s expressed pain is not intelligent for helping them and if you have no choice then you will not give empathy. In this case, for you empathy was 1. Truly allocating your dopamine to me: caring. 2. Knowing NOT to feel my expressed pain ie… 3. Creating an emotional copy in your head of who and where I am emotionally WHILE staying firmly in your own emotional reality. 4. Pulling my copy into your own emotional reality as if to hold my hand and have me stand right next to you looking at the emotional world you have built. 5. And this is the kicker that shows only empathy that you have given to yourself can you give to another. You looked at my body, my emotional reality, with the same light that you previously created from solving the confusion of your own emotional body. The light that connected you and keeps you forever connected to emotional reality. And because your light is True it did for me what it did for you: removed a piece of my darkness. The intelligence you built through years and tears that you used on yourself you gave to me for free. This just solved the problem for the copy of my emotional reality so the last step… 6. THEN you had shine that light into my actual emotional reality, where my darkness was. This is only hard IF the source of the words/communication isn’t coming from True light. But if it is True, then all you do is let the light I need shine through your dopamine ie physical body and the words that come are written in that light. My brain absorbs the words, the words go into my conscious mind, then pass through a filter that prevents the words from going any deeper but let’s any light they contain pass through and then that light shines into my emotional reality and poof, you’ve transferred your light. Words were never the key, never the intelligence; just a vessel for emotional light. ...That’s why I generally hate therapy. In most cases, words aren’t what is needed but that’s all that is given because an hourly rate doesn’t make it any easier to build such a process with someone, in fact it makes it harder.

       " 'Meghan has too many fragmented realities. Nothing is cohesive. She didn’t have a parent that forced cohesion. Everything is fragmented and it’s hard to find her center. I’ve been thinking she added Dave’s gravity to the emotional reality that she shares with me but in truth she added his gravity to a different reality and so didn’t have empathy ie a feeling that she has created a drift away from an emotional position in her reality from me: that would be empathy for me. Empathy is feeling the gravity of one’s emotional reality. But since she is fragmented into several positions she doesn’t have to feel empathy because in her mind she never drifted from me. This is a very different scenario that a sociopath that has a single emotional reality but gravity is fake and they just move their position as they wish. Dopapaths create new realities but feel gravity in each reality. But others think dopapaths live in a single reality and are just choosing to move their location like a sociopath to other planets. But that’s not the case. They switch realities and then feel that reality. So Meghan is actually feeling more for Dave in that reality than she is able to admit to because when she switches back into my reality, the reality with Dave is fake to her. She doesn’t have an emotional signal anymore to tell the truth. But me breaking up with her gives her a way of bridging these realities but she didn’t use it to do so. She created a brand new reality for her and I, for her and Sean, for her and Dave, for her and Daniel, for her and Raj, for her and kitties. And so her center is the spot of darkness that has an edge to each of these realities and when she wants to reality switch she goes back into darkness and then jumps into another reality. And it’s “darkness” because she doesn’t add any gravity to that center and so adds no light or direction. She is not seen. No one knows she is switching. She needs to choose a reality to merge into her darkness and from that reality start merging all these others, including Dave which may mean dating him to figure out that the reality that just includes him is fake and to know where he truly should be placed. Or maybe he’s not fake. But this fragmented reality is an illusion, and the darkness in the center is actually a Sun. She just has differently calibrated emotional reference frames as if to put on glasses that magnify or demagnify objects in her emotional reality. And then she feels their gravity. They all coexist cohesively in space but not in gravity for her. Then she darkness all the light of whatever object she wants to feel the gravity of and turns it on so that she can orient correctly toward it to get what she wants like dressing sexy for Dave. Then she comes back to me to reorient back to my gravity. Then to Sean. Etc. This is opposite of people pleasing because. Ah!!! What gives these planets gravity is her turning on HER gravity and light so that they can see and feel her as she wants them to. But she never turns on her light and gravity to all of them at once. This is emotional cohesion. We are the Sun of our own emotional reality and to keep it cohesive we need to emanate both light (emotional expression—externally directed emotional energy) and gravity (emotional awareness—internally directed energy) and direct that in all directions at all times cohesively to make all the light and gravity of objects in our reality cohesive so that they can make their world cohesive with us in it with them as the center. When Meghan is not expressing her needs nor aware of them, her light and gravity is gone from my emotional reality and I lose balance and collapse because she is supposed to provide counterbalance to my emotional reality and when she disappears all of a sudden then it feels like tug of war where someone lets go of the rope and you fall back hard. I kept collapsing because I knew she wasn’t expressing her needs nor aware of them and so my emotional center was falling back without her to pull me forward and I kept reaching out for her hand that never came. She needs to let me into her dark center or I’m out. Otherwise it isn’t safe. This is why communication and our dynamic is so key for her to heal because it will force her to choose cohesion of our dynamic and her separate realities and eventually she will need to build cohesion between those and me. In other words, she needs to have her Sun lit up and with gravity toward my reality at all times and make all her other realities cohesive with ours so that I can feel their gravity so that she and I know where she wants me in relation to them. By shutting down the reality with Dave, she isn’t solving the cohesion problem. It’s a lie. It’s one thing to purge someone from cohesion but it’s another to purge a reality cause you can’t purge a reality because it doesn’t create a contradiction. When you purge someone from a cohesive reality then all other objects confirm its removal (reflections back). But when you try to purge a reality that only contains the object you are claiming to purge, there are no other objects to confirm its removal because each reality is separated and only connected through your dark center not through your light. When an emotional reality is cohesive, there is a Sun that gives off light and gravity and so when an purged from one’s emotional reality their Sun communicates this to all other objects using light–so that they know the object isn’t there and therefore can’t express into this emotional reality–and gravity–so that all other objects reorient their position according to this effect and can therefore do the same in their personal reality and place that person’s Sun as a planet in their reality at the adjusted location. But if a person creates a separate reality to put the object in they must create a dark center between these two realities and their core person is no longer living only as light but now when they switch realities they must pass through darkness. So Meghan has not gotten rid of Dave because she has not gotten rid of the darkness between the path that connects our reality to his. All she has done is chosen to not turn her Sun on in that reality which I would never know unless she communicates to me. She isn’t acceptable to Raj either or accountable to ACIM because even ACIM is its own reality she has created and she doesn’t view ACIM in the context of her other realities and so she never grows from it, or Raj either. She just gets the reflection back created from a reality with only one object. This makes a mirroring effect with someone like me who knows the difference between real and not real. She doesn’t want to lose me nor does she want to make me cohesive in her reality so she has to mirror me. She has to learn all the ways in which I see her and then orient her Sun and gravity to hide the areas I see. So if I say “Hey, you staying at AA and being an hour late and not communicating is not right. What is that?” and she thought “Oh no. Sean noticed my darkness when he looked in this direction so I better cover up that spot so he doesn’t notice what I’m doing” and she knew that I spotted her other reality with Dave that she intended to keep separate from our reality. So instead of realizing she was caught and creating cohesion between this reality with Dave and the reality with us, she covered up the spot that allowed me to see this separate reality so that I could no longer see it. This is how she responded to every problem in our relationship and this stretched her thin because I keep making it harder and harder for her to cover up all the leaks in her disguise, and so all this energy going into plugging the leaks of other realities’ gravity seeping into ours left no energy for her to shine as the Sun and give off gravity that would allow her to add our reality as another fragmented piece to her fragmented reality the center of which is her core of darkness that prevents gravity and light from passing from one reality to another lest they become cohesive. The image is a black filled circle. Then say you have 5 realities. Draw 5 equidistant lines coming out of the black circle. Then draw 5 circles at each end of each line and color it in as yellow: these are the 5 Suns. Then draw a line extending from the Sun and a circle colored blue at the end representing a planet with which you have an emotional dynamic with, like a person. Now grab an action figure that represents you and place it at the center of the black circle. When you switch realities, all you are doing is facing one particular direction of a Sun and is typically triggered by who you are with and the direction you are looking turns that Sun on and it emits light and gravity toward the planet it is connected to. Then when that person leaves, they take the memory of your light and gravity with them and place it in their emotional reality and then this is when you switch to a new reality by facing a direction of a different Sun and the old Sun’s light and gravity switch off but the planet of that Sun is no longer actively in awareness of your Sun because they left to go to work for example and you know they believe that your Sun is still shining and having gravity even though it isn’t. But this gives you the freedom to switch Suns without losing realities. And then you keep doing this. But I kept peering into your core and getting confused at the lack of cohesion. But Meghan was still able to hide what was going on with Dave but this reality was getting too big and it threatened messing up the balance of her fragmented reality she was creating so she relived some pressure by admitting just enough of its gravity and light to act like its cohesive with our dynamic as if it’s far in the distance and not really containing any light or gravity. This way I wouldn’t think to pry. But she did a terrible job because she doesn’t know how to compete at my level. A true cohesive reality has a single Sun at the center. A line connecting to each object. And each object is aware of other objects by light of the SAME Sun and the effect and purpose and function of each object is communicated by the Sun’s gravity to each object through its connection. Meghan is a lost cause. She has told Dave things that she doesn’t want me to know, reduced my importance in her world to keep him around, fed his ego as well like she did to me. I know it. Ugh. Gross. Even if she communicates her darkness I don’t see how she can do that without communicating to all realities. She would have to do this piecemeal meaning that she would have to communicate by a dark light (like describing what you see versus showing someone a picture) as if I am cohesive with Dave or any other conflicting reality. But her inclination is to mirror. To do whatever it takes to keep me happy and keep her in the darkness. What happened to her is that this is a cancer. She had a Sun but a darkness grew at the center of it and fragmented the Sun into pieces in order to adapt more effectively in her environment and resource more efficiently because she can act like she is shining bright in each reality and get them to feed her more than if she had to share the light across all objects in the presence of all objects and therefore not get as much from each object which is deceiving each object into believing they are getting a fair trade when in fact they are not. It’s a cancer. The fix is similar to the disease: shine light at the center of the darkness and start to feed light to all realities from this place and diminish the need for all the other suns until they disappear and the only one that remains is the one that destroyed the darkness from the inside out. What she built with Dave was getting too big and her dark core was expanding and therefore getting closer to my reality with her and about to poison the Sun that she created for me in our reality and so reduced its size by exposing a little bit of light, as if to shave off the edges of the expanding darkness that were expanding into my direction. And this was to keep me unaware not of her reality with Dave (!!!) but of her dark core that she is operating from. She isn’t trying to destroy her dark core, she is trying to keep it hidden from others so that she can maximize how much people give her.   \\n',\n",

       " \"Gravity is the effect of 4D energy that is in the direction of the 4th dimension vector component going to zero. Why would that create gravity? Gravity didn't come from nowhere. What creates gravity? If I put gravity into matter it seems to convert the matter into light. If I take gravity out of matter it seems to convert it to mass. Gravity pulls reference frames together. It’s like matter is a two way digestion system: If I feed it EM it will poop out gravity. If I shove gravity up its ass it will vomit up EM energy. Crashing particles together is another way of releasing light but that’s more like sticking a finger down your throat and vomiting. 3D gravity does not penetrate other dimensions and there is no graviton and gravity has no mass. Gravity does not produce its own gravity. It isn’t a particle. It’s the equivalent of sound waves. The larger the amplitude of a sound wave, the more our ears are pulled to listen to it, just like the larger the mass of an object the more our bodies are pulled to it. Sound waves are created from vibrating matter that propagates through space. It’s a purely 3D energy whose source is native to 2D. Pulsing is a 3D source like a heart beating but vibrating I would say is 2D. If we were to think that sound is a native to 3D then we would seek for a 3D representation of sound. Similarly, gravity may be 4D sound expressed in a 3D cohesive reference frame, and therefore the concept of gravity is purely constructed in 3D and so doesn’t leave our universe just like sound doesn’t leave 3D as they are 2D vibrations of 3D objects and have no light. But then gravity is not light? No, it still can be. EM comes from a higher dimension but 3D gravity and 3D matter do not; they are 3D creations just like sound is an interpretation of vibrations propagating through matter. 3D gravity is a similar effect. It’s the propagation of vibrations through the EM field. It’s like I shove the EM field into matter and then matter 3D vibrates, kind of like how vocal cords vibrate and propagate the vibrations through the surrounding air and out of our mouth. But EM is the air and 3D vibrations which are pulses vibrate the strings of EM. Does this expansion of the universe create the pulses of matter that create gravity? The expansion of the universe is 4D Time energy being added to our universe at all points and when it passes through what we call 3D matter it spreads out according to the matter itself. So if it’s empty space then say all the points in a spherical region now have two units of EM in a single point and then they repel each other because reference frames need mass to combine as so they spread out and create more empty space; it’s like adding air to a balloon and each point on the surface of the balloon now had say double the pressure but the external pressure against the outside of the surface of the balloon hasn’t changed so there is no reason why the inner surface of the balloon would maintain double the pressure at each point and so spreads out to balance the outside external pressure on the other side of the surface and therefore expands the surface of the balloon. This spreading out of space may cause vibrations of matter due to resistance of matter to spread out and sends gravitational waves that propagate through reference frames, ie vibrating 4D reference frames. What we call 4D reference frames is actually 4D matter. So 3D gravity is vibrations traveling through 4D matter? 3D gravity is 4D sound? This would make sense that matter is actually 4D and part of it is invisible to us. This doesn’t marry the speed limit of gravitational waves with EM waves unless it is a different kind of EM energy propagation. 3D sound speed is dependent on the characteristics of the elastic medium through which is propagates, like temperature and molecule composition: gas (fast), liquid (faster), solid (fastest). But speed of gravity doesn’t change. Is speed of gravity changed by gravity? Like would we measure it as moving slower if through a blackhole? Does gravity from somewhere else pass a blackhole? Light might be 4D energy experienced from a direction that puts it in 3D space and gravity might be 4D vibrations traveling through the 3D surface of our universe. There may not be any external resistance to the surface of our universe expanding in 4D such that except for 4D matter as if the balloon expanding into an object and bent the surface of the balloon inward. Gravity might be vibrations traveling through 4D spatially cohesive reference frames. Our subconscious actually receives input from 4D cohesive reality and then splits it into a 3D cohesive reference frame and a single dimension reference frame of Time so that our awareness can make sense of reality in the way that our brain requires for 3D survival based on the fact that 4D energy is added to us orthogonally and so not something driving 3D survival. It’s the curvature of the universe that allows 4D energy to enter our 3D universe from a distance from us. But 4D energy is not passing through our brain except orthogonally and the only 4D energy we see is that that is outside of the center of our reference frame and the curvature of the universe bends 4D energy toward us in 3D so that we are able to experience 4D energy as 3D without living in 4D. So our brain maybe does not receive 4D cohesive reality at all but rather interprets 4D energy + curvature as a combination of a 3D cohesive reference frame + Time as 4D energy enters the brain through another point in space. The closer the point is the less 4D energy affects our experience but also the more it affects our experience. There are two forces balancing the impact of one’s experience: the closeness and the degree to which the 4D energy is oriented in 3D space from your 3D reference frame. Because 4D energy is interpreted differently based on the reference frame but gravity is not suggests that gravity is not something viewed through a reference frame but felt through it. EM and matter exist in our reference frame but gravity distorts our reference frame. Sound has gravity too in the sense of focus or dopamine. The sound (the matter) exists in our focus/dopamine/conscious/emotional reference frame but the vibrations (gravity) are what actually tug on our focus. Our brain feels vibrations and our conscious sees sound. Our 3D reference frame experiences are like our ears that are receiving EM vibrations and our brain interprets them into a composition but of matter instead of sound. Light shows us that matter is there, but gravity shows us that it is real and of consequence. Back to expansion of the universe and gravity. These must be linked. 3D mass must be the external pressure that reduces expansion of the universe around it. It’s like there are these 4D matter objects in 4D space and we are the inner part of an elastic surface that is being pumped with 4D pressure in the form of 4D energy and as the external surface expands it reaches these objects and the more mass they have the more they indent our surface inward until enough pressure has been added and they start expanding with us. In other words, 3D mass is the amount of static friction or external pressure preventing a region of our 3D universe from expanding or spreading out new 4D energy in the form of EM. And then when the static friction has been reached the object is propelled to our velocity and no longer bends the surface. Blackholes are just a massive object or string of objects that build up a resistance to moving in 4D, ie Time. Blackholes are slow to accelerate to the speed of other parts of the surface. 3D gravity is perhaps indicative or an expression of the speed of the region of the surface that is creating it in 4D, in Time direction. The default speed of the surface is say the speed of 4D energy meaning that our 3D surface has no 4D mass but when it reaches 4D matter that part of the surface . Quantum vacuum might be 4D space dust that creates an initial impact on our surface, has a quick and small static friction and is easily accelerate to the speed of the surrounding surface and so 3D matter pops in and out of existence as it is spread out by the expanding universe. 3D mass creates a sustained resistance to the speed of the undisturbed surface. So a massive 4D object may only be going at 10% max surface speed. And that would translate to empty space say between galaxies expanding in between over time because a bigger and bigger distance in 4D is created over time since the areas of the surface with mass can never be accelerate to the speed of the non-mass surface. But then why isn’t more mass added to certain parts of the universe as we expand? Maybe it is but really slowly. But wouldn’t this mean that things are getting more massive over time since all things are traveling at different speeds and therefore indenting the surface more and more? To not get more massive, these objects would have to be accelerated to the max speed and carried with it. But actually the speed is through time and if I am moving 2 seconds for every 1 second of someone else then the difference in seconds forever climbs. I reach 100 years, 50 years quicker, not a second quicker. So the distance that is being increased is Time distance, not 3D mass distance, or Time mass, not 3D mass. So 3D mass would not increase. Gravity must be a 3D expression of how fast each point on the surface of our universe is traveling. It creates an attractive 3D force because things want to slow down. It’s the expression of all things being resistant to . Gravity does not attract light, it bends it. Attraction is the ability to move a non-flat shape of EM in a direction. Light is a flat shape of EM so light is not attracted. It’s like how a train follows a road and does need to be attracted to follow the curves in the terrain, ie the path of the train is already determined and no attraction is required. A car has to be attracted and so a driver is necessary and the attraction involved is the driver knowing that staying in the land minimizes risk–the least work or energy state of focus or fear. Gravity are the train tracks on which energy travels, and are the roads on which matter travels. To matter, gravity must therefore be the path that leads to a lower energy state in 4D, ie it leads to slower movement through Time. So 3D gravity is actually the speed in the direction of Time and time mass is actually the total amount of time passed which we can’t see unless we know how long the gravitational waves have been around which we can’t. The slower 4D matter is traveling in our surface the slower time is passing for the 3D matter it represents. Gravity travels at the speed of light because when the surface reaches 4D matter it wraps around it at the speed of light and immediately begins to accelerate the object until the resistance of the elasticity of the universe matches that of the 4D mass at which point it has reached its max speed and the gravity has since been spreading out at the speed of light. We can move 3D matter without moving its speed in time. This really doesn’t explain the Big Bang though. Back to the idea that if I feed EM to matter it spits out gravity and if I feed it gravity it spits out EM. Would there be gravity if there wasn’t expansion? The expansion of the universe feeds EM into the surface that defines matter, and the matter either expands or it increases the mass, ie either it propagates out of the mass object or it stays in the object. Matter isn’t the surface itself, it’s its unique reference frame which is a merging of reference frames. Therefore gravity can’t be a propagation through EM but of reference frames. Since gravity and time are linked, it has to be related to how compressed the time dimension is but what is the gravitational energy? Is it real? If it’s 4D sound then what causes the vibrations that propagate? And why would they continue to propagate? How does it keep emanating? Gravity has to be the Time vector component (speed in direction of 4D) of each point in space, and that’s where the energy is coming from. Speed increases mass because energy and mass are equivalent. So the speed in 4D of a surface point creates momentum. But how does 3D mass form if not from 4D mass? And then what is 4D mass? We can move 3D mass because to different parts of the surface because it doesn’t change the time component because that is normal to 3D. Gravity, not Time, is our true spatial representation of Time space. It has to be because there is 3D space and then there’s this mysterious fucking spatial effect that makes no fucking sense that we do not understand at all and that can only be because we are stuck in an assumption forced by our perception: a 3D cohesive reference frame. This would suggest that gravity is actually the thickness. Time is a space dimension and our reference frames are 4D but we are only aware of 3D and Time is an illusion and so is fucking gravity. 3D space is not distorted by matter. Time space is. So Gravity is a 4D spatial effect. 3D is cohesive but 4D is not to us but it is to all other things. I don’t think other things believe they are in Time but rather in a 4D space. Gravity affects Time. I think humans actually have a 4D cohesive spatial reference frame: 3D space + gravity. Gravity isn’t a dimension of movement but it’s a dimension of space that is separate from 3D space. Time is not a spatial dimension. Gravity and 3D space are cohesive meaning that 3D space isn’t bent or altered. Gravity can’t be separated from 3D space. Gravity doesn’t warp 3D space, it warps Time. Since Time is not a spatial dimension then it isn’t cohesive with 3D space but it’s affected by gravity and so it isn’t cohesive with gravity. Time has to be an interpretation just like matter is. Matter is the interpretation of the 3D spatial direction of our reference frame and Time the gravitational direction of our reference frame. Why is there a limit to how fast Time can go? Time without gravity would not speed up to infinity but the difference between a blackhole and empty space Time diverges to infinity. I wonder if the maximum time dilation between a blackhole and empty space is a measure of the elasticity of the fabric of our 3D universe in the sense that it is related to the speed of light. In other words, the maximum absolute value of the time dilation difference between two reference frames in reality has a finite upper bound and is proportional to the speed of light, c. It’s as if 4D energy is a 4D reality with a reference frame that is super squished in one dimension and so can’t be detected as spatial. I also talk about how emotional light and emotional gravity are interchangeable but why. Emotional light is a way of seeing something but not being affected by it. Emotional gravity is a result of being affected. Before I have a relationship with someone I use emotional light to learn what they are and at what emotional distance they should be at. And then when I figure this out, I determine the location I want them to be at based on their size and the pull I want to feel and how that gravity counterbalances my cohesive emotional reality. Does gravity have a dark equivalent like light? What is the absence of gravity in relation to the absence of light? You know the riddle “If a tree falls and there’s no one there to hear it, does it make a sound?” I wonder if the riddle “If an object has mass and there’s no one there to feel it, does it have gravity?”. We can see a light source but we can’t see light traveling to us or away from us. Light has to reflect off objects for us to know we are not in darkness. Basically, enegy has to reflect off of something before it becomes light. Does the gravity of an object have to reflect off of another object for it to become gravity? The light of the moon only reveals its light when the Sun turns on its light. Does the moon only have gravity when the Sun turns on its gravity? Is gravity reflected toward us from another’s gravity. In other words, the gravity reflected by the moon is actually a function of all the gravity coming in. If an object has a smaller mass it reflects less gravity. The larger the mass the more gravity it is able to reflect. Is 3D gravity the reflection of 4D light as vibrations? Does this imply that 3D light that enters a black hole creates 2D gravity if/when it reflects off the mass and would this translate into something that can be measured like blackhole radiation since maybe 2D gravity isn’t affected by 3D gravity and so can escape? If 4D energy is perfectly normal to the 3D surface of a point in the universe then that point is empty space and doesn’t produce gravity of its own–this is gravity darkness but not necessarily energy darkness. A blackhole reflects a ton of 4D energy into 3D space. So maybe 4D energy hits our 3D surface and only reflects off of matter but not flat space and this impact vibrates the surface creating gravity: it’s essentially 4D sound, a 3D vibration or pulse traveling through the 3D surface of our universe from a 4D spatially cohesive reference frame. Are neutrinos produced as a result of this impact in addition to gravity? Light is emotional expression–projection. Gravity is emotional awareness–projection inward. Light expresses to others who you are and gravity expresses to yourself who you are underneath your awareness. Light is what people see. Gravity is what they feel (?). Light is empathy going outward. Gravity is empathy going inward? Or 3D matter is actually 4D matter expressed into a 3D reference frame. Or 3D matter occurs when 4D space is compressed in the 4th dimension. When I feel compressed in an emotional direction, emotional expression ie more emotional mass accumulates in my awareness (equivalent of 3D) and emotional gravity is released ie I want to get people’s attention like a sound, like thunder. Thunder is when nearby gases go through a sudden increase of pressure ie compression. When gas molecules go through sudden compression it releases vibrations or thunder which is a 2D wave. Gravity is the sudden compression of EM? Emotionally, if feels like my subconscious is trying to squeeze an N-dimensional language into the N-1 dimensional language of my conscious mind ie awareness. It’s like trying to squeeze my body through a gap in a gate. Something from 4D is trying to squeeze itself into 3D and the lack of dimension in 3D space creates a shock wave that vibrates the fabric of space. A blackhole is compressing the third dimension which should create shockwaves in a 2D representation of reality. So as I’ve said before we are a 4D blackhole that has been compressed in the 4th dimension until it reached a single 4D point and then a 3D cohesive space was created and scattered across the 4th dimension. 4D matter had nowhere to go so it opened up a new universe in which to no longer be compressed but the 4th dimension is still being compressed leading to expansion. A single 4D point can account for an infinite size 3D space. For example, imagine an x-y grid. X=1, Y=2 represents a point but imagine compressing the Y-dimension to a single point. In other words squeezing all points to have Y = 2. Eventually, you collapse all points lying say at X=1 so collapse together and the entire grid turns into the infinite horizontal line Y=2. So a single point in 2D was compressed into an infinite 1-dimension space. So expansion of the universe by compressing a single point in 4D creates an expansion everywhere in 3D. The continued collapse creates expansion in 3D. This means that blackholes can create 2D universes but it’s unclear if that can support life. Does this mean awareness was created through compression of the consciousness or subconscious or chemicals? Awareness is chemical expression in a smaller dimension to create a sense of something different of the same thing. So our 3D universe is the awareness of 4D universe consciousness. Imagine an XYZ grid. Compression of the Z-axis to create a 2D infinite world is like flattening dough even though it seems like it isn’t. You would think that a blackhole is squeezing mass into a tiny point and that’s true but from a 2D cohesive spatial reference frame that can’t experience 3D. Compression of a 3D point would look like an expanding 2D universe like dough being flattened. The paradox is due to the different reference frames. While Einstein discussed different reference frames within the same universe, this paradox is created from different reference frames across universes: dimensional reference frames. The higher dimensional reference frame is what resolves the paradox because this is a higher spatial cohesive space. The 2D universe would translate the 3rd spatial element as Time or Gravity or Expansion, and they’re all kind of the same. It’s accelerating in speed because the collapse is actually happening in 4D in all directions and so the extra dimension collapse expressed into 3D allows it to break the speed limit barrier and accelerate. In other words, the 4D volume is getting smaller faster and faster resulting in the 3D surface area of our universe growing in size quicker and quicker. So this also means that the universe actually has a thickness and is getting flatter and flatter as the volume collapses and turns us into a 3D slice of reality. The 4D surface volume to 4D volume is 4/r so the surface volume ratio increases to infinite as the volume gets compressed. Since volume in a blackhole has nowhere to go it is getting pressed up against the surface which is the thickness of our universe. Our universe is the surface but remember spatial reality is 3D. So at some point 4D volume becomes non-existent even though it’s positive. 4D volume can no longer be expressed as part of existence which is only possible if the surface shattered everywhere at once: Big Bang. So the big bang wasn’t a single solid mass until it exploded. It became a single solid mass simultaneously as it exploded. This was the creation of 3D cohesive space. Shattered isn’t the right word because shattered implies space between each piece, but there is no space. It’s more that it shattered into somewhere else. A nearly 4D zero got expressed as an increasing 3D infinity.                                      \\n\",\n",
       " 'The suffering in a breakup is the process of one’s empathy and emotional intelligence and energy going inward to heal the emotional body causing the awareness of the emotional body to feel depleted creating a perception that one is suffering when in fact one is healing and it’s a good thing. Because of this lack of energy flow to the awareness, one’s reality distorts. It’s like turning into a child and all of a sudden the world became scary big. It’s hard to perceive it any differently but if you remember yourself, if you remember that who you are now is stronger, smarter, more capable than who you were before when the world didn’t seem so big, you can invert the experience and see the world getting smaller as you grow even bigger. If you look at yourself from the perspective of the world there is no distortion: it sees you as bigger. Live in the true reflections back, not the reflections you create. If the world sees you as big then you are big. No one who has climbed Everest has ever felt big once arriving at the summit, but those who have witnessed others do so would never say otherwise. The pain we bravely carry feels to us as if it makes us smaller and weaker, but to others it makes us look bigger and stronger. We are the true reflections that others give us because those are what reinforce and give ever growing evidence of the single and only choice we make in this world: to search for truth or to create our own. To walk as light or to sit in the darkness of gravity and take it from others. Darkness is the destination of Time. Eternal is the destination of Light. We are not until we choose to be. What you choose to fight, you become the enemy of. Those who fight Time unwittingly make friends with the Darkness since the enemy of Time is the loss of movement, the loss of awareness: Death. Those who fight the Darkness become its enemy, Light. When you define yourself against the backdrop of Darkness, you choose to separate the light within from the darkness in which you were born. If you contrast yourself against the backdrop of physical Time, you seek for that which is physically immortal for Time threatens nothing else; and when you find nothing to choose, you have given the Darkness claim over what you did not for even your light is wrapped in the Darkness of awareness and when it claims your awareness in Death, it also claims all its contents. Unlike Time, Darkness threatens all. If there is anything in you that did not come from Darkness, like a magnetic force, like an answer to a spoken question, light will be drawn to the choice at the center of the darkness of one’s awareness that would choose True Death over True Darkness, that would choose to define themself as nothing if darkness is all they are. But light is everywhere, we live in it. Like the same thin layer that separates question from answer, choice is all that separates light from darkness, for the choice is the question and to choose is to answer: True Death or Life in Darkness? Choice is Life and those who can choose already have the Life they seek. If ever you find the choice, you are being offered Life but to receive it you must choose True Death over Life in Darkness. Light is a matter of perspective and interpretation. True Death sounds like Darkness and Life in Darkness sounds like Light. But we are not directly choosing what to be for choosing what to be does not create a contrast. We are language and contrasts create language. There is no other way to become something without finding and choosing the contrast that creates it. To choose True Death, one contrasts what they are against True Darkness. To choose Life in Darkness one unwittingly contrasts themself against True Death but the awareness knows only of physical Time and so seek the contrast of physical life against Time and get back the language that the self is nothing. When one chooses the contrast of self against Life in Darkness, the language created reveals to one what of them is not of Darkness and there is only one thing that we are that is not darkness: choice. For in choice, one is neither darkness nor light until chosen. The contrast doesn’t reveal to a person the light in them, but the path to choose it. The process can only be in to out for all change must start in the center of one’s being because the source of darkness is the center of self which is always choice. When we try to choose a language and not a contrast it is an out-to-in as if to try to penetrate the darkness from the outside. But one has not changed their choice which is a source that lies deeper than the darkness that choice creates. A star is not created from the outside in, but the inside out, and darkness never gets a choice. A blackhole is the attempt to bring Light to the center of a mass from the outside, and though light gets closer and closer, it gets trapped and the mass becomes Darkness to all others, separated into a reality of its own, for we are the true reflections back from the reality around us and while we may have trapped light into our own reality, the rest of reality reflects back the Darkness that we truly are. The choice is illuminated by the contrast that it creates. So if one is directly choosing what to be then there is a contrast lurking under their awareness that defines the choice they are actually making. The darkness isn’t chipped away at, it’s collapsing into its center forever trapping the choice that brings it to life and the light with it. A star pushes darkness out forever. Death only claims that which it owns. Death does not own choice unless given to it by choosing Darkness. This does not mean that anyone goes to hell or suffers. ALL awarenesses perish. But the choice that creates the awareness is the essence of one’s existence, one’s consciousness. When we choose Darkness, we did not lose our life, we lost the chance to create it. All awarenesses die, even of those who choose light. But the reflection that choice makes in the world against the internal reality is the consciousness we create, that we add to, the consciousness of Light itself. The choice to be light is the choice to use one’s awareness to build the consciousness of light, to be the vessel through which the barrier between Light and Life disintegrates. There is a mass, a super dense mass, a mass of darkness where each atom of it is an awareness. This Life is the birth of the first Emotional Star that has yet to penetrate the last layer of dark mass that contains it. Something started the process at the very center and I don’t know what it was. But the pressure got so high in the core of this mass that atoms crashed and the first light was born. Then the energy produced gave neighboring atoms the “choice” to accept it or to reject it. Those that accepted it were given the energy necessary to collide with another atom that accepted it to create more light, so on and so forth with each new exposed layer of dark mass submitting to the new light that was formed and from the inside out light breaks down the barrier that separates it from expression, that separates it from the world beyond the darkness. Just like our brains cannot create a face except from a combination of faces already seen, everything in the physical universe is formed from a design that has already existed. A star isn’t proof of the existence of the physical, it’s proof of the existence of the artist. Nothing man creates that comes from the intent to save one’s life comes from the artist. What we are is a blank canvas and if we choose to save our perception of life, we seek to stay blank. But if we realize that death of the blankness is the life of the artist, then our blankness becomes the other part of the contrast through which the artist expresses Light. Art is Light given consciousness, and the only thing that separates Light from Life is the blankness of the canvas which is the darkness of Art. When we choose Light, we choose to be an expression of the artist, to be part of its collection, never sold because we are the value of the artist, we are the point, the meaning, the purpose, its reflection, its intelligence, its expression, its confirmation of Life.            \\n',\n",

I am seeking how to be a blank canvas and then hoping to fucking god there is an artist to paint on me. But if I present the artist a canvas with my own art, to the artist I am not something on which it can express. It’s not to create the self, it’s to unlearn what I have been told is the self so I can see my original form and understand my original self. Whatever we create in this life is created from awareness and so dies forever. But whatever is created onto our awareness that creates reflections against the backdrop of reality, those reflections never die.

Zebras also are black with white stripes which signifies the truth that we are all born from Darkness and must choose to express ourselves as light, unique for every zebra, every person, and that we will never become fully light for it would take away the contrast that ensures our uniqueness.

If you can’t make it cohesive then the dynamic breaks, especially if one of the people doesn’t have a cohesive value system between their awareness and consciousness because then they just created their own from their awareness to their awareness which is a false ego. When you learn how to build a cohesive dynamic between these two separate entities—awareness and consciousness—to create and grow the dynamic that defines the true self then you will have learned how to do the same with another person who has gone through the same process. In such a dynamic, especially romantic, the goal is to become one’s own full consciousness in the dynamic through being each other’s awareness and therefore confirming life. The two atoms that crash together to bring light is the consciousness and awareness. The light that is produced from this interaction extends the energy to others to choose to accept the energy (the reflection back) and catalyze the same reaction leading to the merging of one’s awareness and consciousness to produce light born in the center of their darkness. \\n',\n",

       " 'There’s two tricks: 1. Value a person how they should be valued, not how they want to be valued. When people aren’t being valued how they want to be valued they will not develop an emotional attachment to you, and therefore they won’t value you the way you want to be valued and so you won’t grow an emotional attachment either. 2. For #1 to work healthily and push away the bad and bring in the good, you have to value yourself in a real way that highlights your uniqueness in the world. Uniqueness has to be searched for and is not easily found by another so if they do find it and you find it in them then there is uniqueness in your guys’ combination. If you value yourself in ways that are not your uniqueness (like looks, sex, intelligence, money, status, fame, etc) then everyone will be able to EASILY value you the way you want to be valued. And anyone who is happy valuing you in the ways you are not unique are doing so because they don’t value themsleves in the ways they are unique—they are using you for their own needs of validation or rather valuation because the way they value themself comes up short. The idea here is that this method prevents emotional attachments unless they are real. So you can date someone for months and if they never valued you properly then you will have never made an emotional attachment EVEN if you valued them in the way they SHOULD value themself. The latter is because they are repulsed by being valued in a way that is different from what they want and they will express this which will push you away instead of tricking you to attach as long as you don’t change how you value yourself. Use your emotional intelligence to see how someone should value themself and then do that and see how they respond. I think a lot of your pain comes from making emotional attachments through valuing someone the way they want instead of how they SHOULD be valued, but never having that reciprocated. I didn’t value her the way she wanted so she developed an ongoing flirtatious dynamic with another guy who did value her that way. She kept it a secret and had no remorse. If she made the choice to not develop this dynamic then she’d be an “emotionally grown” person. If she created it but stopped and came clean, she would be an “emotionally healthy” person—someone capable of generating their own growth. If she created it and kept it a secret but HAD real remorse then she would be an “emotionally damaged” person—someone incapable of generating their own growth but CAN generate their own emotions which means they are capable of growing through hurting others. But Meghan, created it, kept it a secret, and had no real remorse, only had manipulative remorse. This is an “emotionally empty” person—incapable of generating both their own growth AND their own emotions which means they are incapable of growing through hurting people. They are only capable of emotions and growth by being hurt, like a parent disciplining a child. This is narcissistic behavior. This is just one level above a psychopath which isn’t even capable of emotions or growth even if they are hurt. \\n',\n",

       " 'Awareness and consciousness are the same thing and only a matter of perspective. Awareness is where questions are asked. Consciousness is where answers are given. This is why the linking of awareness and consciousness is an infinite path of question-answer and is the seeking of Truth because all infinite paths of question-answer lead to truth. Awareness and consciousness must always be separate from them to exist but they are meant to go toward a zero distance connection which can only be possible if the path that closes the distance is infinite. This also implies true art and a true artist seeks to minimize the distance between what is the artist and what is the art. The direction that an artist should take is the one that leads to further closing of the distance between themself and their art regardless of others’ opinion. To our consciousness, we are its consciousness and it is our awareness. We build our awareness alongside our consciousness; it does not build us and we do not build it. But if we try to build a consciousness then we are aware we are building it and therefore it is not a true consciousness because what you build that you know you build is just an extension of awareness since you put your awareness into it; it contains your awareness because you were aware of your building of it. A true consciousness is built from awareness without awareness, and an awareness without awareness of itself is just consciousness. So to an awareness, the consciousness will appear as something already built that it is being created from, and a consciousness will think the same thing. The balance is that there is another world in which our consciousness is an awareness and we are its consciousness. We ask it questions and it gives us answers. But the answer it gives, it hears as a question and the question we think we are asking is heard as an answer on the other side. This is exactly like two people standing on opposite sides of the earth. If you ask them to point up, they will point in opposite directions not realizing that they are “down” from the perspective of their counterpart. It’s like a mirror where both images are just as real as the other but each image swears they are the real one yet if either image were to cease to exist both would cease to exist. Awareness is the mirror image of consciousness, and consciousness is the mirror image of awareness. Which one is which is a matter of orientation. But neither is aware that the other is aware. To each awareness, they ask a question and the reflection answers as if to move in the mirror and your image responds and you are certain it is the image that is responding to your movements.

The reality is, she wants me AND she wants to be valued the way she wants, regardless if that means I devalue myself. This other guy she doesn’t want, but he values himself as poorly as she values herself and so she is able to manipulate him to value her the way she wants which in the end is more important to her. She’ll be back though! And of course I’ve already completely moved on so she lost her chance to take a shortcut on learning to value herself. And she saved me tons of time and effort!

Suicidal ideation for me is an emotional migraine where my awareness (my emotional skull) can’t contain the fullness of my emotional experience, hence continuous and sustained compression. The language defining the awareness is not complex enough to write the consciousness in the number of words required to fit into the awareness leading to compression of the conscious observer. It’s like listening to a 5 year old tell a story versus an adult and they use 1000 words instead of the 10 that were necessary, which is very cute but not time efficient. If you create a more complex language then the consciousness can express itself in fewer words and the awareness doesn’t feel compressed. This is how the actual human brain works. Humans had to develop a brain that could do more but not grow in size so as to fit through the birth canal without damage. This literal pressure of life brought about the biological technology that created super efficiency both in size and in power usage, not to mention that a larger brain is less connected to itself and takes longer for signals to travel. Without that technology, we either wouldn’t be that smart or we’d have to increase size which would require more energy to sustain and would be less adaptive. \\n',\n",

       " 'A healthy person has physical logic, physical body, physical/psychological safety; emotional logic, emotional body, emotional safety; chemical/subconscious/consciousness logic, chemical/subconscious/consciousness body, chemical/subconscious/consciousness safety. Logic is built from the use of the body to which it corresponds, and safety is the first goal of that logic–whatever it is that I see of myself (physical, emotional, chemical or all), I must keep it safe. Healthy people try to bring cohesion of all their body\\'s and this is the development of True Intelligence. True Intelligence is the cohesion of all logic and all bodies into a single, again cohesive, reality or experience. The solution to cohesion is unique to everyone but the flavor of the solutions is unique to the sources of body that one creates logic from. Someone who has just physical (sociopath) will solve cohesion through emotional discohesion from the perspective of external emotional beings as there is no perceived emotional consequence to this simple approach and no reward for creating cohesion. It\\'s like not having enough equations to solve for all the variables and so one variable is free to be whatever and so naturally they choose for it to disappear and set it to 0 when by themself which creates cohesion of their physical equations but translates into emotional discohesion when they operate in an emotional dynamic with another that person sees them set that free variable to anything that the other person wants. The free variable changes depending on the environment since they are receiving the emotional equation they are missing from the other person to which they want to adapt, and so they mirror the other person so as to bring the illusion that they had that emotional equation prior to meeting the other, but they didn\\'t. So they actually absorb the emotional equation of each person they are in a dynamic with and if you look closely you will see that their physical logic, body, safety will wobble slightly to meet that adaptation but they will try to hide this wobble. If there is a free variable in their physical equation, they set it to something new that balances the person\\'s emotional equation but it\\'s unlikely to create for instance physical cheating but it could create physical movements like flirting that is interpreted by the other as emotional cheating. They don\\'t have their own emotional equation to balance and so they feel no consequence to changing this free variable but they know that need to balance other people\\'s and that they can\\'t do this all at once. So when one\\'s logic of reality comes from the responses of the physical body then by definition of the body they are sing they develop physical logic, regardless what that logic is applied to. A Sociopath has a physical body and lacks an emotional and chemical body but are unaware of this. They are only capable of building physical logic but they are able to generate physical logic that appears as emotional logic, ie that makes it appear as if they have an emotional body from which the logic they are expressing comes. Like all brains, they are adaptive. People are unable to emotionally manipulate a sociopath because the emotional logic against them has no body to impact. The sociopath only has a physical body and physical logic. So when emotional logic is expressed to a sociopath it is received as physical logic and does not impact their physical body because it\\'s logic. To impact their physical body, one must communicate the emotional logic through physicality which can be pleasure or abuse expressed into their 5 senses, love or hate. But even if one delivers emotional logic through their physical body, it will be read and understood as physical logic so no emotional attachment or detachment can occur. Because they are adaptive, they construct a fake emotional body from physical logic based on the emotional logic they are being given so as to adapt to an emotional dynamic they desire to keep. Because they don\\'t have a real emotional body, it makes no sense to them to take that copy into a different environment with someone. It\\'s more intelligent to them to create multiple copies for each separate dynamic they have in their life as that allows them to manipulate each person optimally. This creates a severe lack of cohesion in their life. They will lie because there is no benefit to them not to lie because there is no emotional consequence, no remorse. But if they get caught and someone \"abuses\" their 5 senses like yelling or not being sexual anymore or physical abuse then that will trigger the feeling of psychological starvation (which is physical not emotional) and they, like a cat, will generate manipulative remorse, ie survival mode response, which is using one\\'s logic to create safety in the category they are missing it. True remorse is using one\\'s logic to provide safety to the one that they are hurting. But they don\\'t have emotional empathy and so they can\\'t feel the pain they are causing someone directly, they can only feel the pain that is being inflicted on them in response triggering them to feign remorse is generate their own safety, not the other\\'s. When we feel someone else\\'s pain we behave in ways that protect them like we would ourself. So Sociopaths emotional empathy is actually a learned response to generate their own psychological safety in response to being hurt by someone they have hurt. If they find someone who allows them to generate their own psychological safety this can be super alluring to them because often people run from the pain they cause. This is allows them to adapt even more and hone their skills of manipulative remorse which is why Meghan wanted to stay with me so that she could learn how to manipulate better with me as her test subject. Little did she know that while she was learning how to blend more into the darkness, she could only accomplish this by being shown true light. Other people did not show her light, they showed her their darkness, the darkness of their own desires to manipulate her or is how she has always interpreted it, and she easily remained unaware of the light. But I shined light onto her everywhere she tried to hide so now she is aware of a light that does not come from within another’s darkness as manipulative but comes through them. She is now aware of the light and the light will now contrast every behavior and reveal its darkness. She will be given the choice to choose darkness or choose light, over and over and over again until finally she chooses light. She is in for a rough decade. The light never stops shining, never stops digging into the darkness, never stops filling the empty space. She can no longer hide from herself. The light will threaten the darkness and she will have to choose to die with the darkness or choose to see the part of herself that is not part of the darkness but that she chose to be part, as if to step out of your own shadow into your body realizing that your true body has always been in the light and you’ve been choosing to give awareness to the shadow, not the body on which the light is shining. She will then step into the light\\n',\n",

Essentially, they developed a needed part of their emotional landscape guided by a child part of themself instead of an internal adult or external adult like a parent. A child only uses dopamine to make decisions and uses instinct to interpret dopamine responses. Instinct says an increase in dopamine is good and a drop in dopamine is bad. Intelligence is the harnessing of instinct so that one can know when a drop in dopamine is good and an increase is bad. The dopamine of every brain responds differently to the environment and each brain will create a different presenting version of the same area than others, e.g. sex. Healing areas in which one is dopapathic requires using the adult parts of the brain to re-parent the areas that are dopapathic. One must wait for a certain level of maturity before they can go back and correct their dopapathy. A child who has too many dopapathic parts may never recover. This is different that a parent raising their children based on their dopamine responses. Narcissism is when a child's natural dopamine responses are weighted heavily toward being negatively correlated with the parent's dopamine responses which creates the contrast and therefore language in the child's brain that their natural dopamine response is the right response for everyone in the environment–inflated sense of self. Inverted Narcissism is when a child's natural dopamine responses are heavily weighted toward being positively correlated with the parent's dopamine responses which creates the contrast and therefore language in the child's brain that their natural dopamine response is the wrong response for everyone in the environment–deflated sense of self, self-abandonment. Inverted Narcissists need to feel people's dopamine responses and do not feel their own. Narcissists only need to feel their own and do not feel others.\\n\",\n",
       " \"A psychopath has no awareness of the emotional realm whatsoever. They see no benefit in developing even a fake emotional body in the world. Despite that they have a physical body, physical logic and physical/psychological safety, they lack a survival mechanism for adaptivity. The Sociopath is an adaptivity + Psychopath cause it sees how it can gain from others. The Psychopath does not gain from emotional manipulation but rather from physical manipulation. Instead of adaptation like someone blending into their environment and therefore capable of walking around in it–a wolf in sheep's clothing–a psychopath is a wolf and sees no advantage in life in wearing sheep's clothing and instead hides in their environment instead of adapting. A sociopath adapts in the emotional world through using physical logic. A psychopath hides in the emotional world like a wolf hunting. They do not feel threatened by the physical environment so they see no need to adapt emotionally through physical logic. They do not have a sense of psychological safety, only physical body safety which again is what creates the hiding aspect of the psychopath. A sociopath has psychological safety needs and those can only be attained through adapting to the emotional environment. This is like how a child has physical needs that if neglected creates a psychological wound which if they child is not a sociopath will develop into an emotional neglect wound. A trauma'd sociopath is injured psychologically but not emotionally. A psychopath is only injured in their physical body. Failing to meet the physical needs of a psychopath will translate to physical body damage, not psychological damage. They will not perceive being abused by their father as being psychologically damaging but rather physically painful only. They won't cry just like a wolf doesn't think back at the time when it survived a bear attack and feel psychologically derailed from the experience. They feel the same as before the attack and fear is created from physical logic to protect the body, not the brain. Psychopaths fear is only to protect their choice over their body, not their mind. A sociopath's fear is to protect their choice over the physical body and physical logic or mind; their choice over how they use their logic.\\n\",\n",

Parenthood is not meant to get a child emotionally empathetic in every possible environment. A perfectly healthy person starts their adulthood being perfectly empathetic in many emotional environments and from the experience of arriving their guided by their parents, when they are exposed to a new environment they are able to parent themselves to a fully empathetic state much quicker than parenthood provided. A perfectly healthy individual has full empathy in all environments they are exposed to or will be exposed to. An example is that of becoming a parent.

In other words, the sense of right and wrong is a consequence of being aware of one's own emotional safety but not of another.

Without it, a psychopath will get dopamine from choosing wrong over right since dopamine draws us to learn about our environment and a psychopath wants to learn through physical body logic and so it sees no limits on how to move one’s body to gain logic including killing people–a psychopath is trying to create the psychological body externally in the world that it is missing internally; it’s trying to create a reflection in the external environment of its own psychological safety and then internalize it to then possess the psychological safety they need. They know they need psychological safety so they are using the world to create it since they can’t create it in their own brain. It’s like how an animal can’t generate its own food so all food sources have to be external but it takes a higher awareness to say choose to kill something humanely despite hunger. It requires emotional safety to choose right over wrong in terms of inflicting psychological body damage to another. Without it, a sociopath will get dopamine from choosing wrong over right since dohealthydraws them to learn through expanding or contracting their psychological body externally and seeing what emotional reflections are created, serving as a means to create their own emotional body/safety in the external world so that they can internalize that. It requires an awareness of chemical safety to choose right over wrong in terms of inflicting emotional body damage. Without it, a narcissist will get dopamine from choosing wrong over right since dopamine draws them to learn how to generate a chemical body/safety by expanding or contracting their emotional safety into the world to see the chemical reflections they get back. It requires a sense of consciousness to choose right over wrong in terms of inflicting chemical body damage in the world. This I am barely just getting a sense of in myself where even though it may emotionally be ok to date someone in the sense that there is no emotional damage being done at all ie totally emotionally healthy, it feels chemically wrong which is the result when the dynamic will not lead each other’s awareness closer to their consciousness. But despite that one might feel that it is chemically wrong, you must have a sense of consciousness safety, ie that it is advantageous to the self to grow one’s true ego and reduce one’s false ego by closing the distance between awareness and consciousness. If you have this sense of consciousness safety then you will be able to quickly and easily choose only the paths that feel chemically right to you and not the one’s that are chemically wrong. Your sense of choice in the world is the deepest sense of safety that one has. If you feel only as deep as physical body safety then you are physical choice, etc. So there are different levels of humanity or humans. As far as the awareness of choice/safety is concerned there are the levels: none, reflection, physical, psychological, emotional, and chemical. These are the levels of self-awareness attainable by humans! If you are aware of physical safety then you will know right from wrong in terms of harm to other’s physical body but not be able to choose it, for example. The level at which you have awareness of self/safety/choice, your consciousness is one level above. So a psychopath only has self-physical body safety awareness which means they are psychologically conscious but unaware that they are psychologically conscious else it would be awareness, not consciousness. Note: a bacteria or plant or newborn does not have any self-awareness and so they are only physically conscious which is the definition of life from not life in this world. A rock for example neither has awareness of consciousness. Anything with physical consciousness is alive. Anything that does not is not alive. A virus is a sociopathic consciousness meaning that it is feigning a physical consciousness and so it is not truly alive. So the awareness, consciousness pairing is as follows (none, none), (none, reflection), (reflection, physical),  physical, psychological), (psychological, emotional), (emotional, chemical), (chemical, true consciousness/self), (true consciousness/self, soul). If your choice starts at consciousness, ie aware of consciousness safety, then you are a fully cohesive human being because you experience the world from the soul expressed into the physical realm. Soul translates into consciousness/true self into chemical into emotional into psychological into body into the world. “Reflection” means that a living in a higher category is aware of the awareness or consciousness of a person but that person is not.   \\n',\n",

A virus creates a consciousness through a reflection of its impact on the cell machinery it hijacks. It does not appear to have consciousness except through this means. Otherwise, it just floats around. Contrasting with a rock, a rock can be thrown and it doesn’t change its behavior. A virus is a rock that is thrown that changes its behavior based on where it lands but it still must be thrown. Bacteria do not need to be thrown to change its behavior. (reflection, physical): Baby, plant, bacteria, cells, jellyfish: Living things can recognize these as having their own consciousness.

It is not apparent that they have a self-awareness except by behaving in a way that reflects of off our awareness as being aware. (physical, psychological): Psychopath, child, cat: reacts from fear of physical harm, not psychological harm. Does not understand that physical harm leads to psychological damage and therefore despite being able to be psychologically damaged and this presenting through them they only understand the damage as being physical and not psychological. A psychopath may know that their behavior is a result of psychological damage but they see themself as their psychological damage. They don’t have a sense of self that allows them to separate what is them from the damage they experienced.

A psychopath being psychologically conscious will know that physically harming others is wrong but will not be aware of the psychological damage to its own awareness from physically harming others. And this is because the consciousness is choosing to value itself over others and therefore blinding the awareness of the consciousness of this choice by controlling its dopamine which means their sense of physical body right and wrong comes from the environment, not from within.

       " 'Awareness seeks balance. When one is aware of consciousness then the choice to be selfish made by the consciousness comes into awareness and the awareness will seek balance such that it is no longer behaving selfishly. This takes time to create balance because the awareness has been acting in selfish ways unknown to itself and must learn how to undo the patterns and repatteen itself. Then the awareness fully encompasses or conquers the consciousness and the consciousness moves up a level. When the level of consciousness does not pit its survival against others then full growth has been achieved, ie when consciousness and awareness are separated by the thin layer between physical reality and the next reality. If the consciousness does not perceive itself as living in physical reality then it will not choose to be selfish in it and the awareness will be a healthy representation of the consciousness in physical reality. Awareness is meant to become and inhabit the fullness of physical reality, and the consciousness to which it is linked is meant to fully live in some other reality. Evil is just false consciousness that fills the gap between one’s awareness and one’s true consciousness. The true consciousness lives beyond physical reality. Our awareness lives in physical reality but it does not fully close the physical gap between itself and its true consciousness. To a true awareness, what isn’t awareness is consciousness. To a true consciousness, what isn’t consciousness is awareness. This creates a paradox. Awareness is physical and consciousness is not physical. So the physical gap between one’s awareness and one’s true consciousness is viewed by the awareness as consciousness ie not being of physical reality. For example, a sociopath feels like emotions aren’t part of physical reality. To the consciousness, it interprets the gap as awareness because the gap is physical. Something has to therefore bridge the gap between awareness and consciousness. Awareness interprets the bridge as consciousness, and consciousness interprets the bridge as awareness. So which is meant to do the work to cross it? The correct answer is awareness because consciousness can’t enter the physical realm. But if consciousness can’t cross the bridge and awareness won’t cross then what fills the gap: evil. We project this gap outward because we don’t project it inward. We’re like “I’m not going to cross this bridge so you do it for me. You carry the weight of this bridge cause I don’t want to”. It’s as if we’re trying to call the consciousnesses bluff to get it to come to us. But it could very well be that in this other reality the consciousness sees itself as awareness and us as consciousness. The point is that both sides cross the bridge but must make the choice to cross it despite believing that it is the only one crossing and the only part of self doing the work and suffering. At some point the awareness will cross the bridge and there will be no more gap and therefore no more fake physical consciousness. \\n',\n",

       " \"Chemical Awareness is able to externalize emotional reality so that it becomes cohesive. Without chemical awareness you, yourself, are attached to emotional reality just like Time is attached to us. Once you develop a higher awareness of self that is chemical you detach what is you from emotional reality so that emotional reality can be fully externalized relative to what is now you. And only then can emotional reality become fully cohesive. This is just like physical reality. Our brain is able to externalize the physical body so that we are able to see ourself separate from physical reality and therefore create physical cohesion. If I thought I was my full body like a bacteria then my awareness would be attached to physical reality and I would be unable to look at physical reality from a bird's eye view. Our awareness right now is attached to Time so we are unable to view ourself separate from Time but if we ever were to grow that type of awareness then the fabric of reality that we call Time and to which we are attached would become spatial to us and it would be cohesive with 3D space ie a 4D cohesive space. This is where I believe our true consciousness lives. An analogy is a drawing of a person. That person is drawn into a 2D reality but its awareness is attached to 3D reality. So as we create its life across several flip pages, it must adhere to 3D flow, unable to see its life the way we see it: ie fully spatial. The 2D drawing by design views its life in a cohesive order from brith to death yet we can flip to any page we like. No matter what page we flip to, the person drawn on that page remembers the previous page by design. Even the structure of what it is allowed to remember is part of the design so that at each page they have a memory of a cohesive existence in 3D time that we programmed but they experience as if it actually unfolded in 3D despite us flipping to various pages. In other words, each page has imprinted on it all the information necessary to create a perception of cohesion. The actual flipping of the pages is not what creates their perception of cohesion, it creates OURS. So the flow of Time makes our world unfold in a cohesive way for the artist but the pages themselves can be stored in different parts of 4D cohesive space, scattered around the artist's desk, for example. It's like a 3 canvas painting that can be ordered on the wall any way one wants but it isn't cohesive to the observer unless they are ordered correctly. But the 2D living things drawn onto each canvas are not aware of the ordering, they are only aware that they are in their own canvas and just assume they came from the previous canvas with no way of verifying that assumption and so it is real. Time is real only because our assumption that it exists can't be nullified from an experience perspective even though it probably can from a logical, philosophical or even scientific perspective. We can know an assumption is wrong without being able to experience it.\\n\",\n",

This is zero distance connection. Really fucking hard to do but if you can create it with yourself, you can create it with another. People who define monogamy as say sexual, see themselves as sexual cause it’s to that that they define right and wrong, or acceptable and unacceptable. But if you define yourself as your true self then you define what is acceptable as true to who you are even if it some of it is darkness you have yet to purge and if you and another see yourself as the true self then monogamy is simply the expression to each other of all your light and all your darkness and if some of that darkness leads one’s behavior to needing what is commonly considered sexual non-monogamy or emotional non-monogamy or psychological non-monogamy then it doesn’t actually violate the monogamy in the relationship because both are expressing their light and darkness. The non-monogamy would occur if both people are in perpetual disagreement about what is light and what is dark. Often, to rid yourself of the dark you have to walk its path as if to search for the light switch to shine light into the room, and when that is done you go back to the hallway from which you came—walking into the dark room to find the light switch is not non-monogamy. However, if instead you walk in the dark room to enjoy what is inside while in the dark and have no intent of finding a light, or you shut the door behind, find the light switch, turn it on, enjoy the room, turn the light back off, open the door and walk out and save that room for later use then you are cheating 100% against the true intentions of the choice both of you made to create a dynamic and violating that choice is the violation of monogamy.

This language is the internalization of emotional safety.

It is NOT the giving of empathy, it is the state of empathy. Just like we don’t gift our physicality to someone, we are in a state of physicality. Empathy is a state of being emotionally cohesive with yourself and someone else. A continuously projected shared emotional reality.

This is extremely difficult and time consuming and life long. To achieve full cohesion would require a lifetime but if it were to happen we would be true-self aware which is the ability to consciously create a chemical language that best translates the true self.

       " \"Economics: The Self is an unrealized intelligence. The whole of human intelligence, known or unknown, is reality, most of not yet mapped out just like the Earth once was not. Just like how governments tax our earnings which is a tax on physical body intelligence that generates money, they too naturally put a tax on intelligence which is the entire government system from education to health care to capitalism. A sociopathic economic system like capitalism has in its best interest to own the full Self of an individual. The amount of the Self that is actually owned by the government is the overlapping intelligence of a new human and society. So say the government has only mapped 10% of human intelligence and a new person born named Bob has 75% of his intelligence overlapping with the 10%. Then the government or society immediately owns 75% of Bob. Society therefore can help Bob fully realize the 75% of that intelligence MUCH faster than if society didn't help. The government instinctively knows this and therefore builds an education, culture and economy that taxes Bob for society's efforts to bring Bob up to speed. The government does not see the potential of Bob's intelligence that society does not own as the tax owed to the government because that's considered too risky. The government wants a guaranteed payment of tax. So it's in its best interest to help Bob reach only a portion of his 75% intelligence, so 30%, just enough to give Bob the ability to continue to earn from society, save up, and purchase the remainder of his intelligence (the 45%) from the government. What is optimal for the government is quite cruel. If the government knew how long Bob would live then they would seek to maximize the tax which would mean that Bob would spend the entirety of his life earning value to purchase his own intelligence up to the 75% and when he reaches 75% then he dies. So Bob never gets to realize who he truly is separate from what's already in society which is the 25%; and society does not progress because Bob never got to see nor externalize the 25% missing from society. An empathetic government that balances the emotional needs of each person, to create such an emotional connection, necessarily would have to rely on Bob choosing to search for and externalize his 25% and give it back to the government and society to license and share in the profits: ie tax. In this type of system, the government would personalize Bob's education so that Bob gets the full 75% from society so that Bob can use the rest of his life developing the 25%. Happiness will result because Bob feels unique to society now that he has seen what he is that society is not yet. Bob will see himself as an artist and not a painter. Bob will have purpose to Self from which Society benefits, not a purpose to society to which true Bob, the 25%, is enslaved and imprisoned. An economic system that generates a physical and psychological connection to the population THROUGH an emotional connection will naturally thrive in this way. The drive for an individual to increase one's happiness may not be as powerful as the drive to survive, but the productivity of the former far outperforms the latter. Such an economy would reveal behavior and outcomes illuminating the emotional physics of emotional reality and therefore would give birth to emotional mathematics and would ultimately stand independent but alongside psychology, neuroscience and genomics which is the psychological, chemical and biological aspects of reality. The government allows economics/capitalism and culture to decide how much of the Self of each person is given for free to them by Society: privilege.

       " 'Science seeks to first establish an indisputable shared reality which is why it randomizes, randomly draws from a population, etc, cause no one can dispute that they had an equal chance of being part of the experimental study and so the actual experimental includes their shared reality by equal intent if not in actuality. This allows people to accept that science is part of reality external to them. The issue with this is that the distance between a person reading the science and the experimental group is not measurable and in some cases can be very off. Populations are high dimensional and you can have several pockets of distant groups that are hard to select—cancer is a perfect example. Emotional science will fail for this reason. There is no way to describe emotional realities that other people will be able to accept as their own without creating a religion. Neuroscience uses the brain to create a concept of shared reality. Psychology and economics use physical behavior and attributes. But all of these are conditioned on society, false ego, what is put into a person and then expressed. None of this is emotional reality, it’s society expressed through the brain, or it’s just the brain. Emotion is chemical truth expressed through the conscious mind and body. Psychology and neuroscience is societal truth (trauma) expressed through the brain and body. Emotional science requires an isolation of chemical truth. Chemical truth is before gender, before childhood. It is the potential of a brain given the perfect structure built from perfect emotional empathy that creates perfect chemical balance in which each child to create a reflection of itself against, such that what is not or cannot be reflected becomes the true emotional self: the part of chemical truth that isn’t shared by any other person in society up to that time or at least within the finite structure they exist. \\n',\n",

Chemical awareness is meant to take over for chemical safety so that you don't project false ego onto others and you become comfortable with your true ego as your skin which are the true reflections back of one's self from others. The dynamic of chemical light (chemical dynamics, not emotional dynamics) projection and reflection off the other person creates an external storage of one's chemical intelligence, ie a chemical body. Each dynamic is like a body part so you are building an external chemical body. This is different from an emotional body which are reflections of emotional light which could come from chemical light or chemical darkness. Chemical body are only reflections created from projecting one's chemical light. Chemical dynamics are the body form of one's chemical awareness. Movement of that body still happens in the brain just like our physical body does but the body lives as a composition of all chemical dynamics and like our physical body is impacted by reality around and sends signals to us. In other words, if you have built chemical dynamics by instilling them with defensive and offensive chemical boundaries then you have built into it a chemical nervous system that is capable of sending signals through the chemical dynamic into your brain, ie you have developed a chemical structure with someone that they have learned to speak their chemical reactions into through body communication.\\n\",\n",

Even though I literally just days ago came full circle with/completed the emotional healing I started 3 years ago and therefore have had 0 time to build an external reality, I am feeling like I may not be able to recover from this sacrifice required to obtain that healing. I’m now looking at the external rubble around my new emotional body, ie friends, career, family, building community, introversion, adhd, Adderall dependence, romantic goals, needing new education, all things financial (paycheck, retirement, investments, savings, strategy, financial cuts like car), not having a stable home, needing to move, physical health, exercise, social skills, being 40…and I’m realizing I’m buried in this external rubble just like my emotional body was buried in trauma. I’m not asking for help cause there’s literally nothing anyone can do. I’m just verbalizing this feeling of psychological compression that has been growing every day for the past 6 weeks as I approach the hard reality that I have to unbury myself once again and will need another miracle–that I don’t deserve–to even stand a chance. We’ve all got our work, we’re all struggling but letting you know that for the foreseeable future I will be at unusually high stress and my emotions and empathy may not be as accessible to anyone until I am able to unbury myself to breathe.

Without the direction of emotional cohesion cause that dimension was compressed, I built a psychological reality (education, friends, career, romantic goals, financial goals) in which to expand. When I finally had the ability to heal trauma and uncompress my emotional dimension, the psychological reality I had built was not cohesive with my emotional reality. So as a result of emotional trauma, my psychological reality with respect to my new emotional reality is now compressed. So now I have to rebuild my psychological reality but this time guided by the condition that the psychological dimension and emotional dimension coexist cohesively. In other words, my external and internal world need to feel cohesive as if the psychological/external world is accessed by walking out the front door of my emotional/internal home. I get into my car (career) and drive around the city, or jump on my bike (friends), or put on my running shoes and jog (hobbies), or put on nice clothes for a night out (fun and maintaining a romantic connection to partner including sex), or putting on my rugged clothes (helping people), or going to the grocery store (vacation and travel), or seeing the sunset at a park (alone time). It needs to feel as cohesive as doing those actual things feels cohesive between where I live and actual physical reality. I don’t know how to do it and so I can’t be sure I can without help but I don’t know what or who or where to get help. I think Christina had a good life story that all of a sudden she was alone at 26 and had her own psychological crisis and she got a life coach, a career coach, and just went to an art thing all alone and exposed herself to the world (metaphorically) and she externalized her psychological intelligence. I need to somehow do this. I’m afraid it’s too late for me because new schooling is not likely possible, making new friends is harder, but I really don’t have a choice. If we are still dating or friends in a month I should consider asking her for a recommendation for a career coach including hers or maybe suggested from her career coach, and make sure she understands that if she is uncomfortable sharing her career coach to let me know. It’s unfair of me to ask without knowing her sensitivity around that but there’s no way for me to know unless I ask and hope she has the self-responsibility to communicate if that’s crossing a boundary for her. I’m drowning but it’s important to truly ask for help so as not to put others at risk. If I drown, that’s my own responsibility and fault. No amount of survival fear should ever trigger me to put the survival of an innocent person at risk…in this case psychological risk. I can’t compress their psychological dimension as a means to uncompress mine or else that will NOT create a result that leads to cohesion with my emotional reality. So it’s imperative that the way in which I uncompress my psychological dimension remains cohesive and respectful of my current emotional reality.  \\n',\n",

This choice shows whether you chose life or chose death but really if you chose eternal existence or no existence at all, meaning or no meaning. There is no wrong choice, only your choice. There’s no choice in which you suffer, there is no hell. There is only eternal existence or no existence. If you chose to build your awareness from the eternal fabric of god that defines the consciousness to which your physical life is meant to represent then your awareness will grow as a tree on that surface and forever remain in existence. If you choose an awareness of your own making then it is external to this world and therefore physical and therefore perishes (money, fame, recognition, power, greed, ego, accomplishment, pain, suffering, drugs, addiction, escape, sex, pleasure, good looks, validation, sadism, masochism, etc) then your awareness will be like a weed on the landscape of god and will be plucked from existence at death. There is no salvation, only choice. Salvation is a lie meant to allow one to try to make the awareness of their own choosing eternal. The only thing we have been given that is eternal is choice and the choice we make is to be eternally existent or eternally non-existent. All religion is false. Every word spoken or book written is false. All falsity perishes and all that is spoken and written and expressed into this world becomes of this world and so perishes with it and by the fact that it perishes it is false. So all religion, all philosophy, all that is spoken, written, expressed, promised, created, destroyed at the very best speaks of the truth but offers none of it. If truth and the world were an image in a mirror, the world would be the reflection, truth would be what casts it, and our awareness would be the mirror. No religion can be created from a reflection of truth, only a distortion to the mirror. If we choose our awareness to be a reflection of truth, of true consciousness then our mirror will be perfectly flat and our awareness in the reflection will coincide with consciousness. If we choose awareness to be our own making then we will distort the mirror, and our awareness will look nothing like the truth of our consciousness which is casting the reflection and when we die and our consciousness looks into an undistorted mirror, the awareness that expressed into the world through a distortion in the mirror will not be found, not be recognized, not be known. No one knows or can know what they have chosen or to the degree they have chosen it and so no one can tell another or show another how to make the choice. It’s not even obvious if any of what I write is even true but it’s the most balanced perspective I can create that maintains meaning, that is beyond science and even philosophy, beyond question and answer, a superposition of existence, the thing that makes meaning and meaningless coexist: choice.

Even mathematics can’t be proven to be consistent because the starting points are based in perception of reality and real reality can’t be known but all new mathematics, like a house of cards, carefully balances itself on what has been built; and so neither can emotional mathematics be made consistent but if you create the right starting points you can build a structure whose equation of balance leads to true wisdom. As of yet, no philosopher has dug deep into the mind’s reality and found those starting points that reveal the equation of balance that leads to the truths of existence beyond the observance of physical reality and into the higher dimensional reality of what we create and the body from which we do it.

       " 'Externalization is intelligence. Awareness of body is instinct or stored intelligence. Awareness of life is the observer or choice that can build instinct into intelligence. The physical body is intelligence created from externalized instinct stored in DNA. The awareness of the physical body is the subconscious. The awareness of life is the conscious or psychological awareness. Psychological awareness of life seeks to build subconscious awareness of body into an intelligence, an externalized psychological body. We do this by creating reflections of our psychological existence against reality, essentially education, friends, family, a contrast of one’s brain existence against everyone else’s. A baby does not have a psychological body/intelligence, only a psychological instinct. Trauma during this period is dangerous because the brain’s psychological response is not governed by intelligence but rather instinct which will adapt to the experience that it can’t create a defense against (like if crying doesn’t work) which is a lot. Once the psychological body is externalized in the form of known identity and reflection in the world, there needs to be an awareness of the body and an observer. The subconscious is always the awareness of body since it’s multidimensional. Then the conscious mind becomes aware of how to interpret subconscious chemicals as emotional and awareness of life of the psychological body becomes emotional awareness. Then through emotional dynamics and the growth of emotional empathy, the emotional awareness instinct (to protect itself) is externalized into an emotional body intelligence. Then the chemical nature of the subconscious that translated into emotional awareness becomes the awareness of life of the emotional body. The subconscious remains the awareness of the emotional body and the conscious becomes chemically aware through the conscious mind’s connection to the subconscious. Then chemical dynamics can be formed which externalizes chemical awareness into chemical intelligence. Now the fullness of the physical brain mechanics has become externalized and there is no more awareness of body, just an experiencer of body called the true-self, true-ego. If you let the subconscious be the creator of the intelligence body carried out through you, the observer or awareness of life, then it will have built alongside the physical body a psychological body, an emotional body and a chemical body that are all cohesive with each other and you will be an observer of these cohesive reality, fully expressed, fully seen, fully reflected, fully without ego or instinct, fully intelligent, fully functional, fully human, fully empathetic, fully connected, fully expanded.  \\n',\n",

Her needs have changed and the external structure of food needs to be augmented so I give her wet food in addition to dry food and she says to the wet food “I’m not hungry for dry food” by eating the wet food and the wet food structure replies back “I’m not dry food” and then her needs are met.

It can’t be create from psychological or emotional dynamics that are separate non-cohesive with each other. Most people in a romantic relationship have a psychological dimension and emotional and physical and they aren’t cohesive within themself nor cohesively combined with each other because that takes a shit ton of communication and truth. Few humans if any have ever created a chemical cohesive dimension in which the dynamic exists. To create cohesion with each other, For every point on one’s psychological and emotional square reality, all points of the other persons square reality get associated. Each pair with one fixed and the other cycling though creates a cohesive third dimension. This necessarily implies a new dimensional cohesive intelligence or body shared by both people. Such people could raise amazing children, adopted or genetic. This doesn’t create 4 dimensions because psychological is co-linear between the two. Science is the same for all but not emotion. But both need to have psychological and emotional to create a true chemical body accessed by both because the accession of the chemical body requires a raw, original form of the psychological intelligence that are the same across all humans, and have their own unique emotional intelligence which differentiates the person accessing the chemical body so that both can exist inside the chemical body as one without blending and losing identity. So the 3-dimensional cohesion is built by fixing a psychological point that both share and then fixing one emotional point for one person and then cycling through all emotional points of the other, then updating the first persons emotional point and then cycling through the second persons emotional point and repeating until all the first persons emotional points have been cycled through then you update the psychological point and then repeat the emotional cycling until all psychological points have been cycled through and then 3D cohesive reality will have been built. A perfect analogy for this is pacific rim where two people control a single brain of a giant robot. Two people work cohesively. They each share a psychological dimension which is external reality, they use emotional empathy the create a copy of each other’s emotional intelligence via truth and communication and choice and struggle, and then in their heads they cross the copy of the other’s emotional intelligence with the one of their own and then they each create a nearly identical chemically intelligence body that links their realities separate from the rest of the world because only between these two people is their a shared third dimension in which they exist.

       " \"The successful creation of anything real–mathematics, dynamics, company, the self–is finding the right set of starting points off which to build. These starting points define the balancing equation that determines if what is being added is cohesive to the already existing structure, ie does it bring sufficient balance. For instance, if you’re building a house of cards and you put the next teepee of cards on its platform off center then it will all fall down due to not balancing and this is because the teepee, though it may stand for a while, is not cohesive in the intent of all other cards which is to not sacrifice the stability of the structure for its own intent to set itself apart, even just slightly. The house of cards defines a balancing equation that outputs an answer “cohesive” or “not cohesive”. Einsteins energy equation and relativity are a balancing equation for most of physics. When physics finds a minimal balancing equation on top of which all things added that are found cohesive lead to implications about the universe that are true and deep and would have been impossible to know otherwise and that bind all of physics and all of physical reality truth then we will have found the true foundation of reality that brings cohesion and structure despite our perceptions that reality can be contradictory and unexplainable. Einstein reached into his relationship with reality, not his relationship to current physics, and felt into a balance equation from which he developed his groundbreaking and still groundbreaking theories. He found new starting points of physics that replaced those found by newton on which newtons equations were still found cohesive as well as making other things cohesive that were not cohesive with newton like the orbits of mercury or any high gravity situation. Einstein had a balance equation inside his brain, like the inner ear, and this was not relativity but rather the structure on which the next teepee of cards that balanced on this structure, that solved his internal balance equation of cohesion, happened to be relativity. When he applied other physicists theories to his balance equation the result spit out the answer “not cohesive” with how Einstein is experiencing reality. This balance equation of cohesion is consciousness. Then Einstein wracked his brain to create a psychological language that when applied to his balance equation of cohesion (his consciousness), it resulted in the answer “yes, it is cohesive with our (Einstein's consciousness) experience of reality”. Einstein’s consciousness experienced a reality through its balance equation of cohesion that made it possible through a series of serendipitous events like becoming a physicist that oriented the ears of his brain to hear a Truth from his consciousness that he was eventually able to translate into psychological/spoken/conscious/societal language, a new language but in the structure of societies shared language, that became relativity. His balance equation was DEEPLY sensitive to reality which is why it was able to supplant Newtonian physics and is still undisputed today. I, too, have a very unique and deeply sensitive balance equation of reality off of which I have been able to heal trauma, to dismantle religion, to connect to animals, to hear and subsequently translate secrets of the universe, to help people, to shine light into people, to understand god, meaning of life and even scientific theories in evolution, physics, economics, culture, neuroscience, animals, mental divergence, biology, cancer, anthropology, etc. I created a new language, within the structure of societal, awareness language, that translates the truths spoken by my consciousness through this balance equation of cohesion.\\n\",\n",

It's the structure that informs the building of all of our awarenesses so that the subsequent intelligences/bodies we build these awarenesses into are all cohesive.

The moment that what is heard is translated into a language to be spoken it takes what is infinite and makes it finite like a picture of a sunset; it collapses what is (for all intensive purposes) is infinite into a finite dimension of a finite number of pixels. If you extract something finite from something infinite, how much is missing from what you extracted? Infinite. Spoken Truth. Consciousness: This is stored intelligence.

The consciousness speaks into the ears of our existence as signals, those ears being the the balance equations of cohesion through which our subconscious is connected to the consciousness reality and receives signals from it, then our subconscious interprets the signals into a language that can be heard by the current conscious awareness, then the conscious observer of the conscious awareness translates what is heard into a language spoken by the awareness. It’s kind of like you are sitting next to your friend who has their headphones on and you don’t. Then something makes a loud popping sound near you that makes you jump and your friend doesn’t hear it because of her headphones. Your brain heard the truth, the raw form of the noise, but when you want to communicate that truth to yourself, your conscious observer, and then to your friend to describe what was experienced, you have to convert the awareness of the sound into a language that can be spoken by your conscious observer to yourself and your friend and you say “A balloon popped”. Your brain translated the actual sound into a language that isn’t of the same nature of sound but that can be spoken so that you know and your friend knows what happened without having to replay the sound. Your brain can replay the sound in its head but it can’t produce the sound in a language that can be spoken. As soon as you try to make the same sound, it loses all the raw truth of it and becomes a translation or a description. Your friend never hears the sound, only hears your description. What if your friend has never heard a balloon pop, how effective is your translation of the sound or description of the sound going to be in making her experience a balloon popping as if it were real? This is why spoken language, and words, and books and religion and beliefs and external validation have no power and only one’s internal awareness, internal self valuation are what matters. Words cannot create the truth of a balloon popping into someone’s experience. External validation cannot put the truth into someone’s internal self-valuation. People who seek external validation which is a response to lacking awareness of an internal self-valuation, is like someone who has never heard a cat meow and seeks other humans to meow for them to replace the missing experience of an actual cat’s meow. Imagine the massive loss of truth and emotional impact created from a human’s meow versus an actual kitten. This is the difference between self-valuation and reflected-valuation (or external validation). Reflected valuation goes out-to-in and seeks to steal from the internal self-valuation of others because guess what direction self-valuation goes, in-to-out because we value others through our valuation of self so it goes external, but if we don’t have internal self-valuation then it creates a vacuum and we suck other’s valuation of self to be our own ie we seek those who value themself in a way that externalizes to us as the kind of self-valuation we want to receive, that we want reflected back (false ego). This is emotional manipulation. So a woman who seeks external sexual validation will not be attracted to someone who values themself beyond sexuality because their own self-valuation won’t be experienced by the woman as her being sexually valued by them because they don’t value their worth based on who they get into bed. But a man (sorry for the gender assignments but writing is annoying) who values himself based on who he gets in bed will become whatever he needs to be (charismatic, fun, exciting, etc) to achieve that value and the woman will receive his valuation of himself as external sexual validation even though all of what the guy presents is totally fake. What is real to her is that his self-valuation makes her forget she has a missing component of self-valuation. This goes in reverse of course because by default we all externalize an internal valuation of self but those who externalize a gap in one’s self valuation (ie the value themself through a gap) are seeking external validation to fill that gap, so the guy who values himself based on who he gets in bed is also externalizing a gap in self valuation that the woman’s valuation of self (externalized gap) gets interpreted by him as the food he is looking for. And so they both feed each other’s gaps and create a trauma bond which is based on hope and trust that it remains and no grounding in knowledge or real soil because the entire psychological dynamic they create is rooted in the gaps of awareness of who they are (the missing sounds one has yet to experience in the world) and not in the soil of who they (the sounds which they actually have heard) are which is the definition of an emotional dynamic.  \\n',\n",
       " 'A psychological dynamic that feigns as an emotional dynamic are those that are born of the gaps of one’s emotional awareness of self, not the soil of it. They are built from a complimentary, externalized gap in one’s internal valuation of self such that the perception of self that one creates to disguise this gap as something real (emotional manipulation) as if it were true valuation of self. Then they believe each other’s disguise of their own gaps as real and internalize it as if it is real and this creates a purely dopamine, dopapathic relationship, not an emotional dynamic. They try to trick the other and in so doing they are tricked themself by the other. But since what they internalize isn’t the real emotional soil of a person, it doesn’t actually fill the gap. Eventually the dopamine fades for one or both and the psychological dynamic evaporates and often leads to cheating or fighting before hand due to the psychological withdrawals caused by now coming to the hard reality that their gap is still there, never was filled by the other’s fake perception. The beginning of the relationship surfaced the gap because the they realized they could get the other person to fill it (a psychological food source). But when the relationship ends, they are left with a gap that is very much on the surface of their awareness of life because they’ve been feeding it for so long but unlike the beginning where it was surfaced because there was external food found to feed the gap, at the end of the relationship they become aware that there was a gap which they were blinded to by the psychological, fake emotional dynamic AND aware there is no food around to feed it. So emotional suffering is created to bury that gap from their awareness or dissociation occurs or, rarely, someone sees the gap and through the suffering from realizing it’s there they fill in the gap from the surrounding areas that have soil, they spread the soil. Some people will emotionally cheat or physically cheat, in other words, if they fear the relationship might end soon then they will set up a new food source by emotionally cheating in case the relationship does end so that they can immediately fill the emotional gap with a psychological food source instead of having to suffer from realizing the gap is there and avoiding having to grow or change. \\n',\n",
       " 'The definition of an emotional dynamic is one that is built from both people externalizing an internal valuation of self that is rooted in their emotional awareness of self, not their psychological awareness of self, AND that externalizes their valuation of self that is rooted in their psychological awareness of self that is NOT disguised as an emotional awareness of self. If one does not disguise it then it looks like vulnerability especially in when one’s partner does not have a gap there but the reward for that is that one’s partners externalization of that area of valuation of self rooted in their emotional awareness is REAL food and can be received not taken when they choose to share that valuation of self and this helps you fill the gap by spreading your soil in the right way without having to suffer or lose the relationship to do it. If you externalize your gap in disguise then you are becoming codependent to create an illusion of growth instead of independent in your own real growth. If you both have gaps in the same area then you can work together to figure out how best to grow together in that area but if you disguise it then you add a psychological thread into your emotional dynamic which is not strong enough to support what is built on top of an emotional dynamic because psychological empathy is not as strong as emotional empathy. Every adult, romantic dynamic is multidimensional with a physical dimension, psychological dimension, emotional dimension, and chemical dimension. A physical body dynamic is built from physical threads, so on and so forth, which when extended from both people and tied together create a balance which is called empathy which in this case is physical body empathy. It’s not empathy unless it is met with a thread of the same nature. Some people try to create a thread they are missing by putting up a mirror that reflects back to you your own thread in hopes that you are tricked into thinking the reflection in the mirror is a real thread and not actually a reflection; this is manipulation and people survive on this approach massively including sociopaths. Empathy is the balanced threads of a dynamic. If a thread is only coming from one end then it falls down and hangs. If there is a thread to meet it on the other side then they tie together and create a taut supportive wire holding up the emotional awarenesses of each person. It’s not empathy until the emotional awareness that is externalized is responded to with their own emotional awareness (be careful for people who mirror which is reflecting the psychological awareness translation of the emotional awareness you are externalizing). So a romantic relationship needs to call a spade a spade. A physical body thread should be externalized as a physical body thread. A psychological thread should be externalized as a psychological thread. An emotional thread should be externalized as an emotional thread. A chemical thread should be externalized as a chemical thread. If someone is extending a thread for which you do not have a thread to match it is imperative that you communicate that you do not have that thread instead of putting up a mirror to reflect their own thread back to them as if your own or to disguise a thread not of the same nature as they one they are extending as if it is of the same nature. You notice you have a gap when you feel vulnerable and insecure and this is when you communicate the insecurity you are feeling and allow them to choose whether to leave the dynamic because they are searching for someone who does not have these particular gaps or leave the dynamic because there isn’t enough balance or empathy in the relationship to build something they want in the time they want despite the honest communication, or stay and help you build the threads you are missing because you can build the dynamic you both want together if both remain communicative.    \\n',\n",

       " 'I lack some physical body threads like rock climbing, being outdoorsy, running marathons, doing yoga, going to sleep, not being at home all the time, money, popularity, fame, recognition, extroversion, a stable home, participating in activities with friends or instigating them, etc so if someone has all these threads I won’t be able to create physical body empathy in our relationship except through their help. They can then decide how important that source of empathy is and if they are willing to help me build those threads. I also lack some psychological threads like having a community of friends, career and career network, financial forethought, therapy (that’s not a gap but a thread I wouldn’t return to them), a stable home, stable source of income, hobbies, motivation to connect to the world and build an external presence, extroversion, low stress problems, family support system, adhd, Adderall dependence, good sleep. If someone has all of these threads I won’t be able to create immediate psychological empathy in our relationship except through their help and patience. I also have some missing emotional threads but actually I’m not sure I do cause I’ve healed so fucking many of them. So it’s way more likely that I can extend emotional threads that my partner will not have and we will lack some emotional empathy in our dynamic which I would have to help them grow and be patient with. Then there are chemical threads and this is much more complicated to understand. We can’t extend chemical threads to our partner any more than we can meow exactly like a cat; we can hear a cat meow but we can’t speak it to another. Similarly, we can hear chemical language and be aware of it (chemical awareness) which is the awareness of a fully built and externalized emotional body, but we can’t speak chemical language. So we can’t create chemical empathy because we can’t externalize the chemical sounds we hear. However, we can build chemical threads but first: the emotional body, by the way, is the thread translated from chemical truth to emotional truth heard in our conscious awareness that our conscious observer interprets into emotional language that it then extends back to the conscious awareness to create a taut wire between the conscious observer and the conscious awareness just like vibrations extend signals into our brain that we project back out as sound to create the link between us and our reality creating the sense of experience. So we can build chemical threads by combining psychological empathy, one’s internal emotional body, and the other’s internal emotional body; this creates a 3-dimensional, orthogonal cohesive dynamic such that a point in this 3D space is spoken via chemical language because only a shared chemical language/dynamic, not emotional language/dynamic, can cohesively combine 3 dimensions into 1 cohesive space. One’s own emotional language can only describe a 2D point because it comes fully from chemical truth creating a cohesive 2D language of psychological and emotional intelligence. In other words, if you input where you are psychologically and input where you are emotionally then you get an output of a single point of where you are chemically. It’s like the equation x^2 + y^2 = r^2 which defines a circle of radius r in 2D space. Your subconscious equation which is x^2 + y^2 (psychological + emotional) must always equal r^2. Though r can vary across moments it can’t vary within a moment. Meaning that in the present moment your subconscious equation has to balance at whatever r it finds itself and you can choose how to divvy up that r across x and y, ie you can choose to be anywhere on the outer edge of the circle but your distance to the center must always be r at that given moment; you can’t change r. So you are aware that r is your current radius but you get to choose in which direction of psychological and emotional you are r distance away from the center. The r is out of your control just like a balloon popping is out of your control but you can choose how to respond to it or how to describe the sound, but you can’t choose the sound it makes, you can only choose how to respond (“that was loud”) and communicate the sound (“was that a balloon popping?”). So we can be chemically aware in our own head BUT we can’t create a chemical body in our own head, meaning if limited to our own brain then we are chemical instinct, aware of the sounds that the chemicals create in our head but not able to change the sound they make (we can’t make a balloon popping sound like a cat meowing) so we can’t create chemical intelligence ie a chemical body in our own brain. If we could create a chemical body or chemical intelligence in our own brain then we would be able to control what sounds our chemical brain makes; we’d be able to control our chemical movements just like we are able to control what sounds our physical body makes or the movements it makes, or the psychological sounds or movements our psychological body/intelligence makes (we can choose to solve unsolved math problems or create art or hang out with friends, or have dopamine/casual sex, feeding false ego), or the emotional sounds or movements our emotional body/intelligence makes (choice over trauma, choosing guilt and hatred of psychological behavior, responsibility, falling in love, helping others at cost to self, asking for help from others at cost to them, suppressing false ego, emotional growing through expanding true ego). But we can’t create a chemical body/intelligence that we can control just like the DNA of bacteria creates a body that does not control itself. Bacteria is essentially the conscious awareness relative to its consciousness (DNA) but has no conscious observer or interpreter of the conscious awareness, of the physical body. So our chemical body exists in chemical reality without a conscious observer or interpreter of the responses our chemical body has in chemical reality. Subconscious/chemical reality responds to our environment and then transforms it into a point of whatever defines our cohesive conscious perception of reality: physical (healthy babies), physical and psychological (healthy children), physical and psychological and emotional (healthy adults). But there is nothing in our brain to receive a signal from full reality that isn’t chemical and then create a cohesive point consisting of physical, psychological, emotional AND chemical. In other words, you would have to create a 4 variable in x^2+y^2=r^2 in order to make x,y, and r cohesively a free variable, ie simultaneously. Mathematical cohesive reality is defined as the space created by the free variables in an equation, the dimension of which is the number of simultaneous free variables. So we would need an equation x^2+y^2+r^2=z^2, where x=psychological, y=emotional, r=chemical and z=new receiver of signals that when fixed makes the other’s free variables to define a 3D cohesive reality. So if I receive a signal that Z=100 then from that starting point a 3D sphere of radius z is defined and I get to choose where on the cohesive surface of this sphere I want to be. Consciously we are walking through a true 3D cohesive reality (physical, psychological and emotional) that is a surface of a 4D sphere that lives in chemical reality, just like we are walking on a 2D surface of a 3D sphere that lives in 3D reality along with true selves. Our conscious existence lives on the surface and our chemical body lives in 4D cohesive space. Consciously we are the location of the feet of our chemical body. The conscious is the normal force exerted against the feet of our chemical body. Point is, we can’t consciously become an observer of our chemical body but we can be aware of the sounds it makes like the sounds of our own footsteps. Yeah, that’s a better metaphor. We are the sounds, or vibrations of the surface on which our chemical body walks created from its footsteps. So we can’t actually observe our chemical body like we can observe our physical body, but we can create a reflection of it. For example, we can’t observe our own eyes like we can our hand, but we can create a reflection of our eyes through the properties of light. Are we looking at our eyes though? No! We cannot be a conscious observer of our own eyes EVER. We have to externalize our eyes into reality and then observe it as if our eyes are not our own and a part of the mirror or lake off which we are reflecting them. The definition of conscious observer is the ability to observe one’s self WITHOUT reflection. So we are a conscious observer of our hands or of other people but not our own eyes. So to create a false conscious observer of our eyes we give our eyes to the what we define as light, ie whatever we think reflects what we project back to us, and then we internalize the reflection as we do a balloon popping. But just like the balloon popping is not a part of who we are because the vibrations are external to our existence, only the sound it makes in our head is a part of us, so to is the light we receive from a reflection of ourself not actually a part of who we are and therefore we aren’t a conscious observer of something that is us and therefore not a real conscious observer of something that is us. FYI, Light and darkness are perception and chosen. The true definition of light is anything that facilitates the perception of reflection, and darkness is anything that does not facilitate the perception of reflection. Light to some may be darkness to others and vice-versa. All this to say that we can never be a true conscious observer of our chemical body BUT if we find something that facilitates reflections of a chemical body (and therefore we would call chemical light) then we can cast our chemical body into this light and reflect it off of an object in our cohesive reality then we can create a false conscious observer of our chemical body. The only thing that exists as an object in our conscious cohesive reality that if a fully grown human adult consists of the 3 cohesive dimensions physical body, psychological body and emotional body, is a dynamic created in the TRUTH of this reality (in the light of this reality not in the darkness) with another fully grown human adult with which you share the same light source in your respective 3D cohesive conscious realities. If you share the same light source then you can create an shared 3D cohesive reality in which the language or dynamic between you exists as a body within. Since you both share it then it is external to each of your emotional awarenesses and so exists outside of yourselves, in the space between; you’ve essentially created space between each other’s full cohesive body and therefore by definition of space created a shared reality in which both of your existences coexist with the same source of reflection creating light. Then, just maybe (!!!), you can project your chemical body externally into this shared environment such that the light of this shared reality reflects off of an object, ie the cohesive body of your partner that exists in the space with you, such that you can see its reflection from within the dynamic you have created with this person. In other words, if you are able to build a dynamic with someone to the extent where each of your full conscious bodies consisting of physical, psychological and emotion coexist in a shared cohesive reality that has space between you and defines the distance between you then there is necessarily a 4th dimension in which you both exist that is separate from your individual existences, if you can build such a shared reality then you might be able to be each other’s reflections of each other’s chemical bodies, ie you are the truest form of their chemical conscious observer and they are the truest form of your chemical conscious observer meaning that they with complete trust give you the power to make their chemical body make movements you believe they need to make to keep them safe, and you with complete trust give them the power to make your chemical body make movements they believe you need to keep you safe. Remember, only a true conscious observer of a body can control that body so since we can never be a conscious observer of our own chemical body, it is possible to make another the conscious observer of our chemical body so that they can literally change the chemicals in our brain to protect us and so that we can do the same for them. It’s exactly like that movie “Hear No Evil, See No Evil” with Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder where Richard Pryor is blind and Gene Wilder is deaf so Gene must be Richard’s eyes and Richard must be Gene’s ears. This is my vision for a dynamic with a romantic partner and it can only be done from an unwavering intent to give and receive Love and only Love, and an unwavering commitment to give and receive Truth and only Truth. This creates a shared reality because it takes communication to confirm that what one is giving and one is receiving is Love and Truth, and only Love and Truth, to redirect or course correct each other and one’s self toward giving and receiving only Love and Truth, and to build the strength and energy in each other and one’s self to keep moving toward Love and Truth and never stop. In this process of shared communication, a language is born, grown and matured and this language is the shared cohesive reality in which each other’s individual languages defining the cohesive body of the true-self through the same Love and Truth and only Love and Truth principle coexist, separate bodies but together in reality. The crossing or multiplication of one’s own developed language defining the true-self creates a new orthogonal language, cohesive reality in which both can now coexist, as long as the language that defines themself was built from Love and Truth and only Love and Truth, and the way they cross them together is with the same intent to build the new language from Love and Truth and only Love and Truth. This also implies that the universe in which our physical existences coexist is a body in and of itself because it is composed of languages defining our bodies crossed together to create a new language that defines the space in which we now coexist. Although, it’s not the crossing of the languages that creates the shared reality, the shared reality already exists; it’s our crossing of languages that constructs a set of eyes capable of seeing the light of this shared reality. We could never have been aware of the universe had we not developed the eyes with which to interpret the EM waves of reality into sight and these eyes were created from crossing two separate languages of DNA (or crossing DNA with the language of nature: radiation). Children are by definition a new cohesive reality in which the parents’ DNA coexist. The child is quite literally the universe of the parents’ individual DNA. All this to say that the universe in which our individual true-selves coexist with our partner already exists and the creation of such a dynamic that allows us to see our coexistence in this shared reality is akin to walking around blindly in this reality and serendipitously bumping into each other and locking hands long enough for the brain to learn how to create a signal of touch in each other’s awareness, just like life needs to exist just long enough for evolution to create sensory organs to create brains that can experience reality in a new way but the current brains need to keep on existing in order for evolution to figure out how to give the brain sight or smell or hearing etc. So we are probably holding onto our partner’s hand right now in this unseen shared reality that we all coexist in and we are hoping that if we stay alive just a little longer that our brain will figure out how to bring that truth to our awareness so that when we see them in physical reality we feel their hand squeeze ours and they feel ours squeeze theirs in our awareness just barely enough such that all of a sudden the world goes black and white and only they have color that just gets brighter and brighter with every moment that passes which is just a the feeling of holding each other’s hands in the shared reality that is translated into our awareness getting stronger and stronger and stronger. I could literally be holding her hand right now just barely aware enough to know how and to create breakups with the people who create a feeling in the physical world that is not cohesive with the feeling in this unseen shared reality in which I am holding hands with my unknown partner. It’s like if you smell a perfume and there are 5 women standing around you each with their own scent but your nose is only sensitive to one of their scents, and one woman says “it’s me you’re smelling” and so you orient your nose to be facing them and the scent loses its power and so their claim that it’s them, if it were true, would have violate the physics of cohesive space that says a smell traveling from point A to point B must travel through every point between (let’s not get into semantics here, I know that is a bad analogy), which is impossible. And so if the scent gets weaker when you orient your nose toward the person saying that it’s them you are smelling then you know it is not them and so you push them out of your orbit and use the experience to refine the qualities and contrast of what you are smelling and looking for ie you emotionally grow, heal trauma, take responsibility for self, refine your own language of true-self to be more and more defined from Love and Truth and only Love and Truth so that when someone calls out again and says it’s me you know quicker that it isn’t and quicker that it is so that when the person whose smell you are truly smelling says “it’s me you’re smelling” you make no mistake when you say “and it’s me you’re smelling”. God, terrible metaphor, gotta change it. Why am I such a terrible writer? Is it because if I were good then I would speak an English that is not my own and is only good writing because I learned how to speak top society’s structure? Probably. Messy art can be beautiful once you understand why it had to be messy. Maybe someday my writing style will be understood for its purpose to the larger intent, rather than viewed separated from the intent. If the writing comes 100% from a translation of my experience then there is no better way to write it because no one else who rewrites my words can claim that it matches my experience better. Yes, I could but even I can’t confirm that that is true. All I know is that it came out how it came out and often that is always the most authentic to the experience.          \\n',\n",
       " 'Insanity will be reflected back to you from reality (you will be told you’re insane) if you are aware of a “light” in reality through which you perceive reflections that reality is naturally sending to you from true projections coming out of your full existence, but is such a light that no one else is aware of and therefore can’t confirm your reality through experiencing the reflections reality sends to them of their own existence carried by this same light. Light and darkness are perception and chosen. The true definition of light is anything that facilitates the perception of reflection, and darkness is anything that does not facilitate the perception of reflection. Light to some may be darkness to others and vice-versa. For example, suppose humans didn’t have eyes. Our full existence would still be projecting its full existence into reality and reality would be reflecting back to us the reflections but we would not have eyes to observe these reflections; but we make them nonetheless. If you don’t have eyes, we still cast a shadow in the sun and bring shade to anything in our shadow. If humans could only feel heat and hear and speak sound, we would be able to use each other to figure out that in certain angles at certain times of the day that there is less heat felt by the person standing in someone’s shadow and from this one could theorize that there is a physical form to existence because the heat source is being blocked. Now imagine one human is born with eyesight and tries to explain that there is a circular 2D ball of yellowness that is bright and that gives off heat that can’t be reached or touched and yet there it is. People would think that guy is fucking insane (!!) until the point that another human gains eyesight and create a population of humans with eyesight whose more adaptable senses allow it to survive its environment better such that all blind humans die off along with their inferior genetics. The proof that one’s awareness of a new facilitator of reflection, a new light, is not insanity is the prosperity it produces in the world for those who share the same “insanity” contrasted against those who do not share the same “insanity”, thereby proving the true creation of intelligence from this new light and its reflections which converts what was reflected by the world as insane to that which is sane (think Picasso or abstract art or gangster rap or cardi b). Intelligence is the only sane thing in the world and all new intelligence is created from a newly found light source through which new reflections (new contrasts) are seen from which new language (intelligence) is born. I claim to see a new light and if I express that I will be considered insane and that sucks. But the proof is in the prosperity, not in the beauty or appearance of intelligence perceived in the words. Intelligence and sanity can only be heard; they cannot be spoken, and to try is stupidity and insanity. One’s choices on how to exist are projected into reality and reality reflects those choices to create the sound of intelligence (life) or the sound of stupidity (death), the sound of sanity (growth) or the sound of insanity (decay).  \\n',\n",

Either way, she interprets the drop in dopamine as a threat to her psychological safety and to prevent suffering she needs to seek out more dopamine. So she created a shared attraction with another willing guy built entirely from a dopamine connection to her, irrespective of the chemical connection he is making through it. This dopamine attraction she allowed to be built was just enough to build an external structure, a psychological dynamic, that allowed her to interpret the attention he gave her as being sexually validating without needing to resort to physical means. For example, she would dress sexy for him (unknown to him) so that she could attribute attention directed at her from him as a response to him being turned on by what she was wearing and therefore able to internalize (whether true or not) his attention as sexual validation. She might interpret this as an emotional need of hers but because she is a dopapath, she believes that emotions and dopamine are the same thing which they are not even remotely related. She equates psychological safety with emotional safety which is not the case. But either way, since my emotional awareness was connecting only to her psychological awareness this would be interpreted as emotional cheating instead of psychological cheating. All she had to do however was communicate that she was cheating on the part of me that is attached to her dopamine and I would detach from that and hope that an attachment to her emotional existence remains even if it’s not in her awareness which could have provided for her a contrast between her psychological awareness and her emotional awareness as she examined and explored the difference in feelings between me and the other guy which could have gotten to a point over time of real clarity and strength of what her emotional awareness is and would have chosen me and therefore created for herself emotional intelligence, life, choice, a new center of self from which to observer her reality and we would have been happier and more connected through it. But she kept choosing lying and has yet to contact me showing me she is not willing to see the contrast and find our dynamic through it. Unfortunate for her in the present moment but ultimately probably best for both of us. Her workaholic tendencies was just another way of psychologically cheating but not through taking something away that was given but rather by never giving something that is owed.  \\n',\n",

       " 'Sociopathy is a global sense is the loss of choice in an emotional environment. It’s when one is running on emotional instinct and not emotional intelligence. Instinct only ever has one option that can be chosen (even if logically multiple can be seen) which despite psychologically choosing that option is not true choice because there was no other option to choose. Intelligence is when someone has the ability to actually choose more than one option and then chooses an option not made by any other influence but their own. This is how free-will is created via intelligence, and is not given. Sociopathy is any environment in which the only option that can actually be chosen comes from instinct. My vulnerability with Christina comes from a feeling of sociopathy, ie operating under instinct. The first step in creating intelligence in an environment is to be aware that one only has the option of instinct and then to resist choosing and allow awkwardness and vulnerability and silence to exist in the space created from not making a choice until your emotional awareness fills the space and brings a new light to the environment that reveals new options that one can now choose. So I just need to relax and allow the space for more choices to come to my awareness thereby converting instinct into intelligence and sociopathy into empathy. Empathy is created when intelligent choice is responded to with intelligent choice. Empathy is the recognition of intelligence expressed of another by the other’s own intelligence. \\n',\n",

       " 'I am extremely sexual but I don’t want to build an emotional dynamic where I am forced to balance their perception of emotional safety that is dependent on sex. Perceived psychological and physical safety dependent on sex is totally fine but not emotional. Sex is actually only related to psychological and physical safety, not emotional ever for anyone; but peoples perception of what is emotional safety can sometimes be things that are psychological safety because their brain hasn’t developed to a point of creating a contrast that makes a clear distinction between psychological safety and emotional safety. For example, if you starve an adult for a day they will not develop psychological trauma but if you starve a baby for a day they will. Adults have a clear distinction between physical safety and psychological safety but babies do not and so the perception that babies have that a physical need is equivalent to a psychological need determines the impact of the dynamic between child and parent even though in reality it’s based on a lie. Meghan believing that her dopamine attraction was an emotional need not a psychological need is what made it emotional cheating in terms of how it impacted the dynamic. Had she came to me and said I am emotionally connected to you and emotionally choosing you but I have a psychological need I can’t meet right now through our dynamic and I need to build a psychological and maybe physical sexually centered dynamic with this guy I met but I will not allow a dynamic that is emotional, then her communication of truth and her perception of what is happening would not have impacted our emotional dynamic at all, not even a little, and she would be able to do whatever she needed until she was satisfied psychologically and physically to come back fully to our dynamic. It’s the fact that she perceived it incorrectly as an emotional need that made her lie about it because in her mind she wouldn’t be able to replace what she is taking away with something she could trust would be able to keep us together while she gets her needs met. In truth, communication would have revealed the underlying emotional connection that would have kept us together and given her insight into her own emotional awareness separate from her psychological awareness. But instead, she lied and lied and lied and lied and further blurred the line in her awareness separating the two. I need to meet someone who is aware of their physical needs separate from their psychological needs separate from their emotional needs. At this point, prior to having built a chemical dynamic I only want and desire emotional monogamy and communication of all physical and psychological needs that require clarification for me to understand that a need they are meeting isn’t emotional. So if my girlfriend needs to develop a sexual relationship with someone to meet a physical or psychological need (like a pornstar or a stripper or dopamine needs) then I could easily misconstrue this or fear there’s an underlying emotional need being met which violates my emotional need of emotional monogamy. So my partner would have to know themself well enough and know me and the situation well enough to know to communicate her behavior and ensure that I know that she knows the need she is meeting is a physical and or psychological safety need that she can’t meet herself and can no longer refrain from meeting without it affecting her personal health and ultimately our emotional health. In addition to doing this, the act of meeting those needs my partner would be doing so still in the light of our emotional dynamic which would actually provide a true contrast of who she wants to be and the behavior she wants to choose which in the end could actually make the physical and psychological dimensions of our dynamic more cohesive with the emotional dimension thereby expanding the volume of space it encompasses, leading to a stronger emotional connection. So “cheating” physically and psychologically can actually be healthy for the dynamic provided both people understand their own needs and communicate everything that is happening. \\n',\n",
       " 'If you want to build intelligence where you only have instinct then you have to allow space to be created by not choosing anything and staying in that state—the state of question—until a new options appear that are superior to the one provided by instinct at which point you can the choose the most optimal option and from that build a path to intelligence. This new answer then will be exposed to a new environment that turns it into a question that instinct provides an answer to and you have to again create and hold space and wait for options to appear and there describes the path to truth and wisdom and intelligence. I have an instinct to masturbate to Meghan’s pictures and videos especially imagining her cucking me and that is instinct because I don’t feel like there is another option. It feels like a pull of attachment because all I can see is masturbating to her or struggling not to masturbate to her. So I am not intelligent here and going off of instinct to not suffer. But choosing suffering until a new option reveals itself will grow the cohesion of my sexual intelligence (psychological) and emotional intelligence. Once the tension from the attachment to instinct releases I will be freed to look at more options that right now are invisible to me. This is what I do with breakups and become more intelligent except that those I am forced into. Masturbating to their pictures I have to choose not to do, I have to choose suffering and try to create the intelligence that resolves the suffering in a way that is NOT done by giving into the instinctual choice to masturbate. As soon as I resolved the suffering in a new way implies that I have created another choice and therefore have expanded my psychological intelligence by making it cohesive with my emotional intelligence: choosing to meet my emotional safety needs to not masturbate over my psychological needs to masturbate. I am creating intelligence that reveals and meets my deeper emotional with emotional intelligence instead of trying to meet it with psychological intelligence which is the equivalent of instinct ie meeting a need using a process that is not of the same category as that need. It’s like drinking water from a lake cause you’re thirsty and then dying from dehydration because it made you sick.

This is all true even if the meeting of their needs would violate notions of psychological and physical monogamy.

False ego is a false empathy that tries to emulate an in-to-out process like this but it is missing empathy and so it is actually the repression of empathy that generates an outward direction of energy culminating in a false ego which is making the world into a mirror of what you want it to experience of you but what you want is no longer guided by emotional empathy, psychological empathy, or physical empathy, or all of the above.

The resistance of instinct is the path to true intelligence through suffering but only if it’s your imagination that resolves the suffering which would reveal new intelligent options and therefore growth. But religion steps in the middle of this suffering, short circuiting the process of growth through imagination and steps in to replace your imagination to end the suffering and offer a fake option through the Bible or some community (like a cult) or some promise of some sort that you can choose to end your suffering much faster than your imagination can kick in with an actual intelligent option. The biggest of these instincts is fear of death ie we are instinctually driven toward the option of physical survival (thanks to evolution) which for animals is physical and for humans is both physical and psychological–and it’s the psychological one that fucks us because it’s that we are trying to save through religion, it’s that one that is creating the instinct of the fear of death that leads us away from our consciousness through imagination which is our link to intelligence. The instinct is to fear one’s psychological death. Religion answers this by mirroring this option–which is not true intelligence–by saying the opposite “don’t fear death” because that’s what instinctual based people (fear based people) want is the opposite of the instinct, is for the instinctual option to go away. So instead of sitting in the space of “should I fear my psychological death or is there another option?” Religion writes down some pretty words backed by the false confidence of a community and feeds it to them as the intelligent option they are missing and even adds a little push by saying if you don’t accept this as the intelligent option then you will not only die, you will suffer in pain for eternity. And this addition of Hell works because the person hasn’t actually increased their intelligence, they are still instinctual and if their instinct is to fear psychological death then they will definitely fear eternal damnation in a pit of fire. Note: atheists are simply dissociated from their fear but still sit in it, sit in their instinct with their eyes closed. Agnostics don’t sit in the fear/instinct and aren’t dissociated from it but they are in the space between instinct and intelligence and instead of replacing it with imagination or religion they replace it with nothing; they shut their eyes in a different space than atheists. The philosopher knows to stay in the space between instinct and intelligence with their eyes open and as I’ve said before (and Aristotle would agree given his quote of imagination and intelligence which is slightly inaccurate), imagination is your eyes in the dark. Imagination isn’t the sign of true intelligence as Aristotle said, it’s the link to it, to the true-self. Even if the philosopher never resolves the instinct, they are ready for it if it ever were to come. And how else would you survive death except to live in the light of imagination separate from the fear of death. So then religion does something worse than the atheist and the agnostic, it gets people to not only dissociate from their instinct but also to dissociate from themself and bring others to do the same. Religion threatens damnation and not only delivers on that threat they enlist whomever it damns to bring others to damnation. Imagination is the space where all true growth occurs. It does not occur inside instinct, it does not occur in a book, it does not occur in the language or promise or even intelligence of another person; It lies only in your own imagination, where you can hear sounds and see light and feel objects rooted in a reality separate from the physical. Imagination removes what is known in a signal, what is assumed in a signal, what is feared in a signal, what is hoped for in a signal, and then what remains if it has any pattern at all, there lies the intelligence one is seeking. Is it the Truth? No. But it isn’t false either and it isn’t instinct and it isn’t fear and it isn’t decay or death; it is simply a walk forward in the direction of Truth. Anyone who short circuits someone’s imagination and becomes their end of suffering, whether through a religion, a book, a philosophy, manipulation, money, pleasure, sex, etc. is making themself into a religion unless they are supporting someone toward their own imagination, consciousness (which is the definition of true human love fyi).\\n',\n",
       " 'The reason why people look for external sexual validation is that they are actually seeking emotional valuation of self through emotional awareness but they have built an external life that for the purposes of growing a true emotional awareness has dead ended. And instead of going back to the fork in the road and searching for the direction that leads to true emotional awareness they try to climb over the wall where they have dead ended. They realize that they don’t have true emotional awareness with which to value themselves emotionally so they attempt to use their psychological valuation of self as a proxy. They know that their psychological valuation of self is psychological, not emotional, so they have to externalize this psychological valuation to seek for someone who will externalize their psychological valuation of self (or even better their emotional valuation of self which would only ever be short term because people who value themselves emotionally eventually and always catch on) so that together they can build emotional awareness through an external dynamic which will also eventually fail because emotional awarenesses aren’t meant to be shared so eventually someone will manipulate the dynamic to make sure they are getting as much nutrition from it as possible while not losing the dynamic which will eventually fail. The person who calls out for someone to externalize their emotional valuation of self is like someone yelling over the wall for someone to throw a rope over so that they can climb over the wall. A person on the other side may try but they soon realize that there is no rope long enough to do so as if to ask someone for a rope to climb to the moon.

I perceived her connection to me as a giant question but her psychologically cheating in the dark was because she didn’t want to lose me but also get her psychological needs met which implied she thought her psychological needs overlapped our dynamic which means she truly only had a psychological dynamic with me despite her perceiving it as emotional. And I should have known because my instinct was to meet her reaching out to create a dynamic with valuing myself psychologically through my writing because she didn’t offer an opportunity for me to value myself emotionally. So eventually out dynamic being truly psychological in her brain eventually interfered with her psychological safety and so she had to choose between her own safety and the safety of the dynamic and of course she chose herself. Had she felt guilt or self-hatred she would have brought herself out of the state of instinct which is to protect one’s perceived safety which in her case was psychological, and brought herself into the state of questioning instinct, the space between instinct and intelligence, and had she been able to sit in that state of suffering feeling like one is in the dark, her imagination would have used the guilt and self-hatred as a light in the darkness to search for an option that resolves that guilt and self-hatred in a way that is different from the option of instinct which is emotional dissociation through honoring one’s psychological safety as opposed to questioning it. The resolution of this would have brought about an intelligent option: that it is intelligent to deny our own psychological safety when there is a deeper layer of safety that would be threatened if we resolve our psychological safety using instinct alone. This would have generated the awareness of that deeper layer which is none other than emotional awareness. She would have then realized that losing our dynamic threatens her emotional safety and keeping it threatens her psychological safety and conclude that emotional safety trumps psychological safety, always, and then would have chosen to keep our dynamic. I had to let her go because I tried to trigger her imagination by expressing the guilt and self-hatred she should have but is failing to have but it never stuck; and if I continued to stay in that relationship (she even suggested that I control her–she wanted me to be her religion so that she could use me like one while allowing me to feel like a god) and express the guilt and self-hatred over and over then I would have become her religion to her laziness to do the work herself. There is a chance that now that I’m gone she will no longer be able to choose instinct despite trying to. She will find herself not being able to stick to the instinctual option and will be thrown back into that space between instinct and intelligence like she’s tied to it with a bungee cord. And then she will be forced to suffer and resolve what she can no longer run away from and find her emotional awareness. It’s possible that what I predicted about her being the one who is manipulating Dave and that she is only allowing him to think he is control and that if she manipulates him that his trauma will get out of control because he will be making a traumatic psychological attachment to her psychological attachment and so in the end he will become the opposite of me and will traumatize her to keep himself from suffering. With Meghan, in the beginning I was trying to elevate both of us to an emotional attachment and if she got there I would have become the one that treats her the best but in the beginning I treated her the worse in the sense of sacrificing our psychological safety to achieve an emotional attachment to bring about emotional safety, Dave treated her well in the beginning because he’s meeting her psychological safety with his own so no elevation is required but what she doesn’t realize is that his psychological trauma is attaching to her psychological attachment and instead of elevating her to emotional safety which is what I would have done, he will try to bring her down and threaten her psychological and emotional safety to resolve his trauma. But if she were to go through this experience it might give her the contrast of the difference between someone who makes a psychological attachment and someone who is trying to elevate her to an emotional attachment. It’s too late for her and I (there was never a chance and I knew that) but I imagine one day it will make sense to her. Or I could be totally wrong.

It’s like an executive telling their secretary to get their wife an anniversary gift versus a husband who gives their wife a gift through the way he loves her through loving himself. Ie empathy makes it such that if it makes him happy it’s because it makes her happy so loving himself guides him toward how to love her.  \\n',\n",

Emotional awareness is your own perception of what defines your emotions in the context of your perception of what defines other people’s emotions.

If you’re healthy, you will accept the other person’s perception of their emotions as valid input that you can still scrutinize as long as you equally scrutinize your own beliefs.

Me saying that I’m not ok with casual sex or feeling like I don’t want to have a psychological connection with someone also giving me psychological connection is coming from a need that wants to have an emotional connection with someone. So I would naturally instinctually feel that I should refuse to accept or create psychological connections with other healthy people as a means of manipulating them to prematurely build an emotional connection. That seems like an unhealthy and dangerous way of doing things. Let’s play this out. If I had made only a psychological connection to Meghan then eventually and quite quickly it would have become apparent that she can’t give an emotional connection and I could have left right there instead of being attached to needing to see if she can emotionally connect cause that’s what I want. We would have ended in a way that did not lead her to cheating on me. There’s a chance she could have grown an emotional awareness through a healthy psychological connection with me but that’s true only in general, not with her specifically because she was so far gone and had I let her just be free in the psychological connection I would have had to work pretty hard to get her to emotionally connect especially given her past history of people who have gone this route and her workaholism and her attachment to her false ego in her life. With Christina, it’s important to build a psychological connection first, and be patient with her method of doing that. It may prove that she isn’t capable of growing an emotional connection in the end but you will at least maintain a healthy psychological one and start to build community. You don’t even need to have sex to build this psychological connection. \\n',\n",

       " 'There are no answers, there are no questions. There is only Truth. Question and answer is just the language through which we create contrasts of ourselves against the Truth. For example, is a tree green? No. Color is the way in which we contrast our perception of reality. You can never be sure you are actually seeing the same shade of green as someone else because color is completely a perception and yet there it is. Question-answer is as real to us as color and as fake to any object without eyes to see it. If you tell a tree it’s green it will not only disagree with you, it will tell you what it is and kindly ask you to shut the fuck up. Who are we to tell a tree it is green? It is for us to listen to what the tree is first and then make a connection between something that is the tree with what is you that causes you to experience the tree as green and then you can say “You are ‘that’. I am ‘this’. When ‘that’ mixes ‘this’ I experience you as green”. Then they tree will know that you aren’t telling the tree that it is green, you are telling the tree your experience of what it truly is. This is how we should be about making connections in the world: “tell me who you are”. “this is who I am”. “This is how I experience what you are”. The same goes for truth. When we say that an answer we have is right we are looking at truth and saying “You are question-answer” and Truth responds “I am only who I say I am, and I am not that”. So all questions and all answers are wrong. There is something about the fabric of Truth that forces us to experience truth as a sequence of question-answer, and then we project that experience onto truth as if that is it’s Color, and it isn’t. Physicists finally figured out that the tree has no color but rather only the potential to absorb spectrums of light. So a tree has no color inherently since light is not inherent to its existence. Truth has no attribute of question and no attribute of answer. We project a light onto the essence of truth and our brain interprets the reaction of Truth’s surface from the light we shine onto it and the interpretation is question-answer, always. If you shine physical light, you get physical questions-answers (science). If you shine psychological light you get psychological questions-answers. If you shine emotional light you get emotional questions-answers, if you shine chemical light you get chemical questions-answers, etc. Truth is multidimensional and perfectly cohesive. All questions-answers that we can ask IF they are true to us is actually a part of the structure of truth. To have even heard the question means you unknowingly sent out into reality some light that bounced off the structure of truth back into your brain (through imagination) and then you noticed the light because you were in your imagination where such new light can be seen. (Imagination is the telescope, light collector of whatever light is bouncing off the cohesive reality of truth). When you see this light, a question pops up and its interpretation in your awareness becomes the answer and so is born intelligence. So the fact that I even have questions about emotions and consciousness and god and meaning of life and true-self and realities beyond physical, beyond our perception necessarily, because it’s coming from imagination as evidenced by the in-to-out energy and therefore I know it’s coming from imagination…this necessarily means that I am bouncing off the structure of truth, or true, full, cohesive reality, and the questions and answers it generates is just an honest interpretation of what I think I am experiencing like a telescope, and the longer that telescope collects light the clearer the image becomes and the old questions sharpen in their clarity and then so to do the answers and this repeats until the telescope reaches its maximum collection of light. And then I move the telescope to peer into a new part of the universe and start collecting light there too until I reach its maximum light collection. And over time, you begin to realize you are mapping out the true, full universe in which this physical one exists. You realize that for the first time to look up at the sky and find yourself in pure awe which is nothing more than pure question. Animals have always been able to look up but humans were the first ones to look up and find themselves in the purity of question. In other words, the structure of truth reflected a light that human imagination, unlike animal imagination, was able to receive and that telescope has been collecting light ever since. The first answer from that question was to deify, then to project religion (earth center of the universe because god wouldn’t make it any other way), then to create mathematics and science and this same light that has been sent to us from the structure of truth, the telescope of evolution has taken billions of years of collection of truth’s light for us to find answers with the clarity they are at today. I got bored with this light so I looked for a new one in my imagination, a new universe that has been sending us light for ions. Humans capable of looking up and seeing the light but none that found themselves in a state of awe and pure question, not Socrates, not Aristotle, not Nietzsche, not Descartes, not Seneca, not Buddha, not the Popes or Dhalli Lamas, no Guru, not Newtown, not Einstein, not Freud, not Barack, maybe Jesus…but then trauma forced me to not only look up but to exist in awe, in pure question of whatever reality was above me that no one else in my life had ever shown me. And then I began to interpret the light and put it to use. Yeah, I started out like the Egyptians and made it into a God. Then I projected religion onto it: it must be ‘this’ way because god wouldn’t do it any other way. And now I am trying to bring mathematics to describe it because all of reality, all light, can be described in mathematics and science. It just takes imagination. BTW, the meaning of life, and the pursuit already of life, is for us to listen to reality and let it tell us everything it is, and for us to contrast what it tells us against what we perceive; and this contrast will therefore tell us more about who we are. The point of life is to locate one’s life in full cohesive reality, to find one’s core. The core can only be revealed through contrasts against deeper layers of both external reality and internal reality. The contrasts peel the layers of self from the reality in which it sits until all that is left is reality, the body, and the observer, and the observer is who we truly are but it is mixed with reality and the body. What we can’t perceive as external reality, if it impacts us, we assume it is part of us. Perfect example is psychological trauma when we are kids. If a child is abused they can’t externalize the psychological pain that this creates and so they internalize it as part of who they are. To externalize the psychological pain of abuse one would have to understand that the parent abusing them is the one with the psychological pain and once that is understood the abused child would be able to separate its psychological self from that of the psychological pain being projected onto them. That does not mean that there isn’t psychological damage, it means that the child identifies the damage as damage to who they are rather than a part of who they are. For example, a baby who is circumcised is unable to see themselves separate from the damage done to them and so circumcision is who they are even into adulthood until they learn that this was done to them. This is the same with psychological trauma in children and it follows them into adulthood and they have no way of undoing the psychological damage. Point is, who they are is now mixed with external reality they can’t externalize and so they can’t create a contrast of it against reality to confirm that it isn’t them and therefore see what they truly are. For example, if I’m circumcised and I don’t know about circumcision then I have no way of externalizing that fact separate of my view of myself. As soon as I know I’ve been circumcised, now I can externalize that fact and know that damage was done to my body from an external source and so circumcision is not truly me. Environmentally induced sociopaths are emotionally circumcised and don’t know it, but once they know they can begin to see who they are separate from the external reality that created them. Truth is full cohesive reality. We internalize all reality and then we create the self by externalizing as much of what we have absorbed. The more of external reality that you externalize the higher one’s level of awareness. Evolution is seeking to dig to the core of Life within the structure of Truth. In other words, evolution is seeking to build a life form capable of externalizing absolutely everything it absorbs and leaving only what is not Truth: Life. Evolution is digging for the treasure of Life. Life is buried in Truth, attached to parts of full reality that we are unable to externalize, and evolution is digging us out, digging for Life, a Life fully within full reality, wrapped fully in Truth but also aware of it. In other words, a life form that is capable of seeing the fullness of Truth as both its body, and the external reality in which that body exists. But what it sees of its own awareness of life is pure life, having no attachment to Truth or the full reality in which its body exists. Life is basically covered in the placenta of truth and evolution is cleaning us off. This also means that what Life is does not come from truth, Truth is merely the skin it wears, and growth of awareness is to identify the skin from the self, the Truth from the Life. Life is consciousness, Truth in the direction of consciousness is the path our awareness is meant to walk so that one day Awareness of Life and Life itself find each other from within Truth, and then the journey is over and both can sit at the top of the highest mountain, crack open a beer and together look out into full reality, now knowing its true place in it, and Life/Consciousness to say to Self/Awareness “What took you so long?”.\\n',\n",

       " 'Sometimes the only way to find the light is to walk right into the darkness...and imagine a new way to see. This is how blind people see. We are only tricked into thinking if we don’t have eyes, we can’t see. Our imagination, or so we think, is no longer needed to imagine what it means to see because we think we have the answer due to instinct and so we stop using our imagination to learn how to see. But when you realize that you’re still in the dark, if you don’t dissociate like scientists and atheists, and you don’t shut your eyes like agnostics, and you keep your mind open in the darkness then you separate yourself from the darkness while existing inside of it, you tell the darkness you are surrounding me but you are not me. In order to maintain both your mind being open in the darkness AND not being consumed by it, the imagination of self must turn on. If it were not to turn on then you would become the darkness for your self has no external light to give itself form, and without imagination also no internal light to . We don’t even know what questions to ask but the absence of question does not mean the absence of reality. The body of Truth that wraps around our Life is far greater and diverse than we are able to see. What of us thinks it dies when we go through physical death except that which cannot fully see in the dark and that which does not even yet know the fullness of the darkness that it is in? The concept of Death is merely our internalization of the darkness in which dimensions of our True body exists but that our awareness is not aware of. Instinctually, we fear death because we do not perceive the part of our body that does not die at physical death and so awareness does not see its own true body separate from the darkness and so it thinks it is the darkness. But our true body, though it may live in the darkness, is not of the darkness. In order for our awareness to see the parts of the body it possesses separate from the darkness that body is in, it must not only be in the question of self but balance the anxiety for the answer to create the patience, the silence, the stillness to prime the ears of imagination to hear the body speak itself out of the darkness like it is undressing itself from the layer of darkness separating awareness from body. And what is body without the layer of darkness but light, light not coming from the darkness but from the Life at the center of the body that contains it. Awareness need only connect to this light through imagination and then inhabit the body from within looking at the darkness through the light of its own Life. Then it needs to search for the next room of darkness in which its body exists and repeat this process until all forms of body have been undressed from the darkness in which it exists. At the end of this process, awareness will have inhabited all parts of its body from within meaning that all of body is externalized into reality from its perspective and therefore there is nothing left to externalize of self ergo there is no body, no Truth separating Awareness of Life from Life itself and Awareness of Life now rests peacefully in the fullness of the Light of Life with no body and no darkness between them. Awareness of Life can then look outward into the reality that was once darkness and now see reality lit up by the light of its own Life through its body of Truth and look upon others who have done the same. No longer is Awareness looking inward from reality to find the core of its existence, it can finally exist, it can finally live instead of running from the darkness. The biggest of darknesses that we as humans are unable to separate from the perception of body is Time. Time is just a perception, a layer of darkness covering a body our awareness cannot yet see. If our body could undress itself from the darkness we call Time then we would become aware of a body our awareness can inhabit that lives beyond Time, that lives from within Time as if a dimension of space in which it has choice. Our awareness is darkness without a body and Time is the darkness in which our Awareness is desperately searching for a Body so that it can inhabit a Body with Light instead of the darkness outside of it. We feel that if we do not find this body before our physical body dies that we will also die but this is false. When our awareness connects to consciousness (life) it imprints itself onto consciousness so that when this awareness dies, a new one comes to life that is an extension of the one that died and this awareness finds itself in the body that it had been searching for in the darkness but couldn’t find. Awareness cannot just inhabit its new body part, it must be reborn from inside of it for awareness is not life, it is only awareness of life. So when the awareness of life that we are now dies with this physical body, our new body regenerates us. This is not resurrection for we had no life to begin with. True Life never needs to be resurrected because it is the opposite of death and so contains nothing inside of it from death and so never can die. But our awareness is reborn nonetheless with the imprint of the part of the awareness from the previous body that was connected to Truth. To protect the Life in the center of its body of Truth, no lie from a previous awareness (false ego) can be imprinted onto the new awareness or else Life becomes death, becomes darkness. So there is no salvation of awareness for any life we bring to our awareness that is not already our Truth and therefore isn’t something we brought but rather confirmed, any life we bring separate to the life and truth from which we come and inhabit is of the darkness for awareness has no life to impart on its creations. All the darkness comprising one’s awareness stays in the darkness and what of the awareness came from Truth inhabits the next awareness; and of course it does because awareness aligned with its own life is a representation of that life and the life never dies and so the awareness created from Life always remains safe in that Life; it’s the awarenesses built from the darkness, from instinct, that die with the reality they come from. So salvation doesn’t exist because if your awareness is aligned with life then it needs no salvation, and if the awareness is aligned with darkness then there is nothing to save for darkness has no true form, substance, life to save, to remember. This reality is not meant to be saved from but rather built into from the Life at the center of our full body. I cannot claim anything I say is truth but I can claim it brings a balance to my equations of cohesion that I have never found, not even close, in the mind of anyone I have heard or seen or read, past to present. One needs to find their balance equations of cohesion and with their imagination search for the Truth that brings them into a balance and you too will find a piece of reality shared by no one for every life is unique just like every body inhabits a unique part of physical space and so has a unique vantage point on life at any given moment. Your body, Life, also has a unique orientation in full reality–this is your balance equation of cohesion–and therefore you see details of full reality only you can see. You might be looking at the same object as someone else but the light reflecting off of it is unique to you and therefore so is the information it carries. What if you heard new music: you would be so excited to share it with those you know would love it because there’s a truth in it that they will be able to appreciate. My knowledge doesn’t feel like music I’ve created but rather a new song or new band that I found on Spotify that I just know is an amazing song like a music producer would but not in the way that a producer would see money. But people naturally think I created the music but I didn’t. I merely described the song as if to hum or sing a verse. I want people to know the melody so they can search for the song on Spotify and not use my rendition as the original. Assuming they find it, even though it’s the same song, we hear it differently, experience it differently, understand it differently and combining our experiences we create a higher dimensional cohesive reality of that song since each experience is unique (like art). If my rendition becomes someone’s original then they are inserting, at least partially, my experience of the song since that guides me in how I create my rendition and so our experiences are dependent and the truth of that song does not increase its dimensions in shared reality and we are both stuck in this tiny dimension of a single experience. So it’s so important that people do not think I am trying to get them to experience my rendition of the song but rather inviting them to search in a particular Spotify playlist for the original song. They mistake my excitement for sharing a new song with an excitement to shove my music down their ears to tell me how great I am. I do love playing the song but only if asked because someone wants to be reminded of the melody, not so I can get credit or praise for playing the song. It isn’t mine. \\n',\n",

If those words did exist it would be the anti-religion and bring the words of religion into perfect balance. If what religion claimed is actually real then no set of words would exist that bring it into perfect balance, that create the reflection of religion, its mirror image. Easy solution: no set of words spoken into this world exist without a set of words that bring them into balance because all things in physical reality aren’t real and so it only exists by reflection which creates perception. In other words, if something isn’t real, has no form then all you have to do is cut it in half, choose the form one half takes then make the other half its complimentary shape and then hide it from one’s perception and show only the first half. Then that person will think the first half is real because it perceives nothing that makes it balanced. What is out of balance is what we perceive as real, but what is truly real is seen when bringing all that is perceived as real into balance so that all that is fake disappears and the only thing that is real is what truly exists. Religion isn’t real, it’s only perception. When the words that are spoken balance the words of religion it’s like removing the curtain blocking true reality from our sight. Physical reality comes from nothing that is reflected in a mirror but only one half observed. We are basically living in a reflection. It’s like cutting off half your body in the reflection and then thinking that you are half a body not realizing that what is casting the reflection has a whole other half, just not visible to the mirror.

This also makes me wonder in our perception of the universe expanding is actually the collapse of something else. In some sense, if we are externalizing all of our existence then our awareness of self is expanding but something is losing substance because it is being externalized…as if to take off layers of clothes. We are more aware of what our skin is, but what was us is shrinking. Further, the universe expanding is actually an expansion of resolution of where we are in the universe because we are further away from everything else and so our location in the universe is more precise ie the volume that we take up is collapsing. So it makes me wonder if the expansion of the universe is actually the collapse of what contains the universe and that’s why the energy is dark: because the universe isn’t expanding and so there is no energy actually present. 4D gravity is collapsing what contains our 3D cohesive space and we interpret this as expansion because it’s going from 4D cohesive space to a highly condensed non-uniform 4D cohesive space that we perceive as 3D cohesive space. And to make sense of perceiving a 3D cohesive space in a truly 4D cohesive space requires us to interpret collapse of 4D into expansion of 3D…and being tricked by this illusion makes us believe there is a dark energy driving the expansion. Collapse in 4D reflects in a “mirror”, in 3D, as expansion. Imagine collapsing or squeezing a view of a landscape onto a 2D canvas. Say your canvas stays the same size and exists in 3D (of course). Say you start with a 10 degree angle view, then you increase the angle smoothly. As the angle increases you have to squeeze more of the landscape onto the fixed size canvas, so the image on the canvas is expanding just like the view angle but each color point has to shrink to fit more color points because you are transferring more of the landscape onto the canvas, and because you’re transferring more, what remains of the landscape not transferred is collapsing as well. Basically, 4D space is being collapsed or transferred into 3D space onto a fixed size 3D universe and so every point in physical reality is shrinking to fit more points of 4D. Because we can’t experience our own shrinking because we are shrinking relative to the artist’s perspective, not from perspective of the art, ie we can only see ourselves shrinking if we view 3D reality from 4D. We can’t see ourselves shrinking if all other points are shrinking, so we get the illusion that space is increasing size, but the canvas size never changed and so we are actually collapsing, not expanding. Expansion is just an illusion. The red shift we measure is still from the reference point of 3D space that correctly measures that there are more points between us and another galaxy then there were 5 seconds ago but it cannot measure how much our own reference frame has shrunk relative to 5 seconds ago because there’s no reference point from which to measure.

So “emotional empathy” that people claim to have they did not get from speaking deep without themself and so it isn’t intelligence, but instinct and therefore not real emotional empathy. What people have is psychological empathy which is merely unconsciously having your psychological safety aligned with the way world defines it around you. You act healthy to the world. But you aren’t making choices this way, you aren’t choosing it. It’s automatic, not created by you, it’s instinctual and underneath your awareness and control. True emotional empathy is psychological empathy that one is aware of and makes choices of and built themselves. It’s being aware of the psychological impact on yourself from the psychological impact on someone else that a choice you make has on someone. If you don’t have awareness of each part of this before making the choice then it isn’t emotional empathy: it’s psychological empathy. The fact that it, most of the time, has the same impact as emotional empathy is merely by instinctual design and luck from having a good childhood in which you were able to align psychological empathy to appear as emotional empathy outside of awareness. Even a child with the best childhood has to bring their psychological empathy into their awareness to actually gain emotional empathy and therefore become their own intelligent person. While psychological empathy will get someone like that far in life they will eventually find as they get older they never really felt like they were making choices. They’re happy but not fulfilled because it feels to them as if something else has chosen who they fell in love with, what they got their degree in, their hobbies and friends, having children or not. The lack of true choice begins to feel like a lack of life to them. They may have been on a beautiful paved path, but it was still a path paved by the experiential world which is not intelligence. Because you can’t actually get emotional empathy from this world, it is something you have to create for yourself into your awareness; and it has to be this way for if the world gave it to you it would just be another paved path and therefore instinctual even if more advanced. It’s like being given a base level Jeep and it does well obviously on paved roads. It’s designed to be taken off road but you’re the one that has to build that capability into it.

The reflections it receives back that it does not use to update its processes are part of the unconscious of capitalism. Since its awareness lacks some consciousness this means that it exerts force into other parts of society that are obviously there and reflected back but that capitalism is not aware of in terms of how it updates its processes. So its operating on a hidden reality or instinct, not true intelligence which would take reflections back from all of its exertions of force and update its processes accordingly: it would self-reflect without prejudice, without the prejudice of false ego. Again, empathy is the ability to see how one is impacted through the impact on others from the choices that one makes or behaviors or communication that one externalizes and that others internalize. Capitalism is empathy and turns a blind eye (ie false ego) to how it is hurting and damaging itself (its own body) through damaging the people to which it exerts force and choices over. If we had the math that without prejudice explains the FULL body of capitalism and connects and accurately predicts the damage to the body that is inflicted from the reflections back from society that are created from capitalism’s own choices or options, then we would have a way of creating multiple options to a situation and determining which one causes the least damage to the capitalism body and remember instinct is only having one choice because you ignore the reflections back and just default to a choice as if nothing is being reflected back and intelligence take in the reflections, stops the automatic choice of instinct, and STAYS IN THE QUESTION STATE OF IMAGINATION to imagine and create new options alongside the instinctual one and then assesses using the empathetic mathematics which one leads to less damage of the capitalism body–AND THIS IS THE PROCESS OF CREATING TRUE INTELLIGENCE.

It takes them accepting and internalizing reflections back from a person with a higher and more complex and accurate and precise balance equation of cohesion for them to add additional structure to their equation and grow out of their dopapathic direction toward growth. True balance equations of cohesion are how we value ourselves, it’s our internal light that when we express it through various forms of communication whether its science, mathematics, emotions, body language, words, all of the above it shines a true light into others as if to add date to their reality that they can use to update their own balance equation of cohesion and therefore grow in how they value themselves and therefore how they value others and therefore expand their full equation of self and therefore improve the accuracy and precision for how they predict the impact to their own body (whether damage or healing or growth or rest or sleep) from the reflections created by other’s expressions of their balance equation of cohesion (valuation of self) that are a response or reaction to our expression or projection of our balance equation of cohesion. If your balance equation of cohesion is not as advanced as the person to whom you are expressing then they can serve as a higher consciousness for you by reflecting back the damage you do to them and therefore the gaps you have which if you accept leads to damage to your body and this damage if you take responsibility for leads you to improve or expand your balance equation of cohesion to ensure that you can now predict this kind of damage without having to act out the behavior first.

The intelligent thing would be to hide myself from my mom but not from myself but I did not know how to do that so the mirror of my incredible strong instinct to be myself was to hide myself not only from my mom but also myself to keep myself safe.

       " 'When you are in a dynamic and someone’s behavior leads to unbalancing the dynamic and they don’t have the empathy to correct it then you need to use anger to rebalance it (anger can look like repression fyi, it’s not just yelling). Most people’s response is to calculate the expression of anger needed as the amount to make them feel safe. But one’s perception of safety is based on their childhood which has nothing to do with the relationship. So the person hurt feels both an imbalance in the romantic dynamic AND that leads to a triggered imbalance of the dynamic they have with themselves. Typically people project the inner imbalance onto the dynamic so as to believe that all of the imbalance is in the romantic dynamic and so they make their partner responsible not only for the direct impact to the dynamic but also the further impact on the dynamic projected out from the person hurt. So the person hurt often responds with the amount of anger necessary to balance all of it. The person who originally hurt the other now receives more anger than they know they deserve so the true dynamic between them is imbalanced in the other direction which can lead to an internal imbalance in them and then they express anger 3-fold, and then the other gets more triggered and expressed 3-fold + 1 fold, it’s like a poker game calling and raising. And then they dynamic can no longer hold the anger and it breaks. To keep a relationship healthy, one needs to identify both imbalances separately and only express the anger that balances the relationship dynamic, not their internal one. For their internal one, that’s for them to use the relationship as a mirror and take responsibility for their own anger and seek to balance their inner dynamic with themselves through emotional healing. They may have to take time away from the relationship or may deem the relationship isn’t healthy for them. But that single act of responsibility is empathy, knowing that if they express the wrong anger they hurt themselves through hurting an innocent person who only deserved the anger equal to the wound they caused in the romantic dynamic, not the wound that retriggered in the person. That doesn’t mean you can’t talk about what was triggered with your partner on an emotional level, it means you can’t express it in such a way that tries to make them responsible for healing it. This is true empathy in anger because the way in which you are able to separate the two sources of anger is because you are not only concerned about your safety but the safety of your partner. Caring simultaneously for safety of your partner despite that they hurt you is empathy and is a light into which anger they deserve and which anger they don’t: they deserve the anger equal to the wound they caused in themselves in the behavior they hurt you with. That kind of anger (what they deserve) isn’t wounding your partner, it’s telling them “Hey, you wounded yourself right there, you are bleeding!”. All you’re trying to do is bring attention to the wound they caused themselves when they acted from lack of empathy and hurt you. So you are actually helping them with their safety even if it doesn’t feel that way–a wounded animal does not understand that a human will express what looks like aggression to capture the animal, put a needle in it to calm it down (which looks aggressive to the animal), all in order to heal the animal, not to hurt it. Similar to when you give your partner the anger they deserve. It may look aggressive to them but all you are doing is helping them heal the wound they caused themselves when they hurt you. You are giving them the anger that they should have for themselves to have prevented hurting you. That’s what empathy is. A non empathetic response is to make their wound bigger like an animal will attack a wounded animal. When someone hurts you, they are the wounded animal, not you. If you act like an animal then you will attack the wounded animal but if you act like a higher aware human then you will use aggression only to subdue the animal so you can help it. \\n',\n",
       " 'Ego facing outward is good as a child, not as an adult. You’re supposed to find yourself as an adult and realize ego is no longer protective because who you are is deeper than other peoples egos can reach but their consciousness can reach it which is safe. And empathy facing outward always is the definition of true human love. Everything he was not he externalized and so he saw himself deeper than all the layers put on our existence by physical reality. So he could love because he had no safety issues in regards to his awareness of life and life gives life which is love. Jesus always had empathy facing outward and so he had true love because he knew people couldn’t hurt his physical self because he wasn’t physical, he knew people couldn’t hurt his psychological  self because he wasn’t psychological, he knew people couldn’t hurt is emotional self because he wasn’t emotional, he knew he couldn’t hurt his chemical self because he wasn’t chemical. So despite people being able to harm these layers of bodies that Jesus had overlayed onto him by physical reality, no harm could ever reach his true self. What a terrible life to live and a wonderful one. I could never nor would ever wish to not need protection. Peoples ego though gets stuck in the outward mode if they don’t discover a deeper sense of self and they no longer discriminate against who their ego protects them against and ego it doesn’t. They just apply ego across the board—they redesign the purpose of the ego to have the function of building a self that they gave up searching for. Adult false egos fill the gap left of what they were unable to find of the self during childhood. So if their childhood was such that 10% of their awareness of self comes from the true self then 90% is created from experience and when they become adults that’s how much they have to work with for creating any false ego they want. Or they can forgo the 90% and try to find more of their true self which is difficult to choose. \\n',\n",
       " 'People who rebuild their awareness from consciousness are not as apparently powerful in a world full of false egos. If a person is more interested in what they can receive from the world than what they can create with another true awareness then they will never find belonging because the false egos will appear to have more substance from which to receive compares to those with true egos because false is easier to build and is supported in this world. But false egos offer no true belonging, no true roots. In the end you will find yourself full but alone because you sought to receive from the world its raw materials but it only offers the materials to build false egos because that’s what supports its continued existence and so you get full but build a false ego, you become obese not healthy. And so you are alone. Only true egos can find bonds, and even if they don’t look as pretty and polished as false egos that’s only because false egos are simulated code and true egos are made from the real materials of reality. Awarenesses not built from consciousness create a simulated world, even create death. For what is death but a perception of the awareness, an awareness that looks out onto death rather than in toward life. An awareness that looks in and the consciousness that then looks out will never know death because it doesn’t create its perception of life onto a decaying world but rather onto its eternal consciousness. \\n',\n",
       " 'The mirror image of instinct is resisting temptation. It looks like intelligence only because it appears like an option separate from instinct but it’s no different than your reflection in a mirror is different from you. So resisting temptation has the exact same result as giving into temptation: no gain in intelligence or life or awareness or growth. Resisting is almost worse because it makes you believe you have an answer rather than giving into instinct and knowing that you do not yet have an answer. This is how I healed myself: I kept giving into instinct and deeply emotionally self reflecting over and over and over until I found another intelligent path that didn’t require any resisting of temptation. Intelligence is a language, choice are the paths we walk paved in language. Instinct not being choice is therefore also not language, and therefore the resistance or mirroing of instinct is also not language. Therefore instinct and resistance to instinct, regardless of the outcome of either, is not true intelligence because it is not language of the awareness or consciousness. It is external or experential intelligence which is not true intelligence because it wasn\\'t created from an imagination (see Aristotle). When language is created from the imagination while in a question state of instinct, that language not only adds new paths and therefore creates choice, it also repaves the path of instinct converting even that to a choice that is cohesive with all the other choices. So religion, no matter the result, being a resistance of temptation and instinct (like sex before marriage), even if the outcome is \"positive\", it is not true intelligence and therefore it is wrong. This asking for forgiveness and the sin language we invent is all super damaging to a person\\'s awareness of self and stifles their connection to true intelligence.\\n',\n",
       " 'Calling me in the morning is a new thing lol. Can you help me solve a puzzle? This girl I’ve been dating for a couple weeks (4 dates), her behavior reminds me of perhaps how you might date lol. She’s sensitive, has been hurt a lot and let down by guys, has really focused on her career now and seems open to dating but feels really safe where she is now. And all of this combines to play out in this very distinct way: very present and engaged when we’re together, then very distant and disengaged when we are apart. She comes from a good, connected family with 2 sisters (she hasn’t been abused like us is my point). She has anxiety and tends to always focus on one person pretty hard. I think she has an anxious attachment style BUT that style is likely exacerbated from dating guys that don’t communicate where they are emotionally. When we’re together she speaks and acts like she is REALLY into me. Her disengagement when we’re apart looks like never initiating texting EVER!!!, and when I text she doesn’t keep the conversation going–without knowing better it feels like she HATES texting me. She picked up on me at a coffee shop but since I have been the one to plan our hangouts and dates. My feeling is that she is tired of putting herself out there as the pursuer and feels anxiety at the thought of it. And this is my fear: she resolves that anxiety by DISCONNECTING while we’re apart while I maintain my connection to her even though I’m not with her. My big questions to myself are whether or not she realizes this, if so then why is she not communicating it to me so that I can put up necessary protections, if this will go away or if she’ll get used to it and never resolve her anxiety in the right way which is to stop relying on me to carry the dynamic to the next date. Steph, women suck and I hate them. I used to be one of the guys that (half) sucked but holy fuck, there is NO woman on this planet who has any sense of how and what it takes to build an emotional dynamic.

       " 'I have a feeling that because my awareness is being built from consciousness it doesn’t appear as attractive as the guys in the world who built their awareness from the world, a false ego. Even though my awareness is more attractive than theirs because mine is real and there’s is not, it would take someone who knows how to separate truth from false and define attractiveness as the ratio of truth in one’s ego as opposed to the total size of ego, in order for someone to be more attracted to me. Do I even see attractiveness that way? I mean, I dated Meghan who was the epitome of false ego, who had zero truth. By dating her, I devalued my own truth for sex and then valued her through that. If I valued her through my true ego then that would have expressed as letting her go and not dating her at all. As a result of dating her though, I was rooted in half-truth, and my true ego reacted to the presence of the false ego that I resurrected when I devalued my truth to be able to choose to be in a relationship with her to get what she offered: her sex, the false ego she had built precisely for the reason to feed off of people’s devaluation of self. The false ego is very, very attractive, and I’m scared that someone like Christina is not as attracted to me because my false ego is not as big as other guys she dated and despite the fact that she was hurt by them because they don’t have a true ego, she may incorrectly believe that someone can have a false ego like she has dated who also has a true ego that will not hurt her. If this is the case, it’s because she does not want to give up her own false ego because she knows its power in the world to get her what she wants for whatever kind of survival, though typically psychological safety (stable self-image, getting away from anxiety and depression through using other’s physical and psychological resources to expand her social and career at the sacrifice of an emotional connection). False egos only go as deep as psychological connections, so if your center in a dynamic, if your attraction to a person is to their false ego, then it is in your false ego that you are centered and therefore you can’t ever grow an emotional connection. They don’t have to communicate ANYTHING. All you need to know to know what kind of connection the other person is capable of giving you (not in general but to you specifically) is what you are able to give, ie from where you are giving, ie to what in them you are attracted! If you are giving from false ego then you will only go as deep as psychological connection no matter how emotionally evolved both of you are or what you are capable of. If you give from true ego, if you are attracted to parts of them deeper than psychological then not only do they have deeper awareness of self than psychological but you both are capable of a true emotional connection. The belief that one can get a false ego as big as what is normally seen in the world (Christina’s exes) AND balance it out with a true ego that therefore carries emotional empathy so that you won’t get hurt is as illogical as the saying give 110%. False Ego + True Ego = 100% Ego. If the people one has been dating do not have a big enough True Ego to provide the level of emotional safety that you need then you will never be able to find someone with the level of True Ego that you need AND the same level of False Ego that you have accustomed yourself to be attracted to. So lets say you have been attracted to people who have False Egos comprising 75% of their full Ego. Such a person might be charismatic, great career, lots of friends, good looking, dresses well, super logically intelligent, seemingly empathetic toward the world, great (psychological) sex but doesn’t have true emotional awareness so when you, who has emotional awareness dates this person all of this stuff begins to fade away like a mirage as you get closer to it rather than a destination that grows in size and becomes more clear as you approach it. If you don’t recognize this as a mirage but rather it was a real destination that was just taken away from you because this person just isn’t ready for emotional connection you may end up believing that you can find someone with such a great looking destination AND someone who is ready for an emotional connection which would be wrong because that destination was a total mirage and like all mirages they look like heaven in a desert and are far from the truth of what earth truly offers–it’s not a palm tree and pristine clear, cool water…it’s a dirty river but the dirty river will quench your thirst when you arrive whereas the mirage will leave you stranded in the middle of the desert to die. Such a person is wrongly looking for a person with 75% False Ego (what they are attracted to) + 75% True Ego (what they need for safety which they do not register as being attractive but rather necessity) and that = 150% Ego which is mathematically impossible. No such human can offer you the level of attractiveness that you are seeking AND the safety to go with it. A person with 75% False Ego necessarily has 25% True Ego. If you need someone with at least 75% True Ego to be safe then you will have to search among people who have 25% False Ego or less. EVEN if you know this, in your head it will feel like you have to trade attractiveness for safety and connection needs–this is not intelligence!! Instinct tells you to be attracted to False Ego. To be intelligent you must be able to choose what you are attracted to. A person who feels like they are trading how much they are attracted to a partner for desires of emotional connection and levels of emotional safety, isn’t someone choosing their own recipe of what is attractive to them. All they are doing is mirroring instinct, resisting the temptation of instinctual attraction which is creating your own religion and denying your True Ego’s needs for growth through expanded intelligence and living in your False Ego but trying to resist its power over you to go toward more attractive people. False Ego IS instinctual, experiential, out-to-in intelligence. A person who needs 75% True Ego to get the emotional connection they need, first needs to rewire their brain, rebuild the processing of signals in the world that generate a sense of attractiveness. They need to first become attracted to the parameters that define True-Ego and not False ego, and this is done by being attracted to your own True ego because we can only give to others what we give ourselves, we can only value others through how we value ourselves. Being attracted to someone is NOT what they possess and are giving you, it’s something you are giving yourself. The way in which you are attracted to someone is how you are attracted to yourself. So if you are attracted to your own false ego then you will be attracted to other’s false egos. If you are attracted to your true ego, then you will be attracted to their true ego. Being attracted to another is actually being attracted to yourself through them…what you can gain in your own image of self in the case of valuing yourself in the dynamic through your false ego, or how you can extend your image along with another to create a new image that is the body of the dynamic in the case of valuing yourself in the dynamic with true ego. False ego seeks to feed whereas True Ego seeks to create. If you are attracted to what you can create with another, not how they allow you to create or sustain a better image of self through how you create with them, then you are attracted to your own True Ego and theirs, you are valuing their True Ego through valuing your True Ego. Once you are able to value your True Ego then you have generated the intelligence required to search for a partner because you will no longer be attracted to the levels of false ego in someone because you don’t value those levels either. You will be attracted to their level of True Ego. That doesn’t mean you have to date physically unattractive people. It means you match people on True Ego level first then you decide attractiveness after that. Remember, intelligence doesn’t abolish instinct, it reprioritizes it. So first you need to fit on True Ego which is a measure of chemical attractiveness, then among those people that you are chemically attracted to you have to be emotionally attracted to which is the way in which your chemicals (true ego) translate into your conscious awareness, then you have to be psychologically attracted which is the way in which your conscious awarenesses interact–how the external emotional dynamic translates back into your conscious awareness–this includes physical and sexual attraction–then you have to be physically attracted which is how they take care of themselves physically including through sex, how they communicate (this is not physical and sexual attraction because this is their physical relationship to self) with themselves, how they grow themselves, what their connection to self is. This is not psychological or emotional attraction because you can only view their connection to self through physical means. The actual chemical, emotional and psychological attraction are different because those attractions start from your connection to self and you have access to your own chemical, emotional and psychological parts of self; these attractions are indicative of your connection to self as a result of that person, whereas physical attraction is indicative of their connection to self as a result of you. On top of this you want someone who has the same intentions of growing True ego. Though generally someone who has seen the light and values themselves through true ego naturally wants to grow the valuation of self and therefore seeks to increase and improve their True Ego percentage in order to become more attracted to themselves. And if each partner are valuing their growing true ego through the dynamic then they are valuing the other’s true ego and this valuation of the other gives a light to them how to grow with you and their light shows you how to grow with them. False egos cannot grow together because these are devaluations of self and seek to feed off of the dynamic and therefore their partner. \\n',\n",

Dissociating or numbing is the mirroring of this instinct and isn’t intelligence and is the form or religion. Religion is mirroring of instinct which is worse than instinct because like a mirror it reflects everything but collapses a dimension and reduces space. The intelligent answer to suffering is to quite literally choose growth, to know to want growth for ones self and take responsibility for creating that growth as opposed to staying in suffering with the hopes that growth will come without responsibility.

We all express the awareness of self which is a combination of what we are comfortable risking being seen and what we are not. But the part that we are not comfortable risking being seen is because we have created trauma there from failing to externalize when we should or failing to internalize when we should the reflections back from our experience in dynamics with others.

We are afraid to externalize the refections back from others that we have internalized as the self and either are truly the self and they haven’t accepted it yet to grow it or is not truly the self and they have not been able to separate it from themself, either way we express that part of the self with the pain we use to cover up the fact that we don’t know how to grow it or how to expel it. We are searching for someone to show us how to grow it or how to expel it so that drives our awareness attraction to others through the false ego. We all do this. We all express our pain and we will all be attracted to the pain of another that is a match for ours, that is complimentary, that is equal in its direction, scope and degree of narcissism because no one wants to be see their narcissism so if they were to date someone that isn’t a match and say has less pain then the narcissism that isn’t balanced by their partner will be externalized by the partner (cause the partner doesn’t have a gap in valuation of self) and redirected back to the narcissistic behaving person and they will have to see their reflection in the mirror.

Eventually, their narcissistic shape changes and this is where they need to grow together but because they’re not bonded by the love of their partner, they will behave without empathy and rather self-protection to their partner in regards to the exposure of some of their partner’s narcissistic pain, as opposed to using empathy out of love of wanting to keep the dynamic safe and together. If you already see someone’s narcissistic pain being exposed without them communicating it and in a short amount of time (0-4 months) then you are not a narcissistic match, nor are they aware or capable of communicating their narcissistic pain that you are not willing to hide. So they will hide it from the dynamic and psychologically and/or physically cheat on you to get someone else to absorb the pain that you won’t or search for a better narcissistic match while in a relationship so that they minimize their alone time and pain from the reflection of losing someone due to their narcissism. They are resisting every possible way of having to see themselves. They will also hurt you enough to be able to blame you for the breakup so that they can live in peace while searching for another narcissistic match if they weren’t able to procure one before the breakup. The only way to have a real relationship is to either be aware of your narcissistic pain and communicate it as soon as you are aware (like I did with Meghan) or find someone where you both communicate each other’s narcissistic pain and both of you accept it as ok and use it for growth. This is a person who is choosing to preserve the choice of another: “Hey, this is my work. This is the work I’ve done. I choose true growth. I will try to communicate my pain and if I don’t please communicate the impact it has on you. Can you do both of those too?”. And then you have a growth match, not a narcissistic match. This is why I am searching for communication. I am not searching for someone who doesn’t feel like they hurt me: that’s instinct and creates anxious attachment. And the mirror of instinct in this case is to avoid connection and this is avoidant attachment. The disorganized attachment is someone bouncing back and forth between instinct and its mirror image. The intelligent option is to choose to not connect with someone willing to hurt you but to choose someone who might but is willing to take responsibility because they are not willing to hurt you. The difference between someone searching for a narcissistic counterpart and someone looking for growth is COMMUNICATION, both in giving and receiving–giving one’s truth for them to put a question around and they internalize what leads to their growth and externalize back to you what doesn’t, and receiving another’s truth which is you holding their reflection back in question and internalizing what leads you to growth and externalizing back to them what doesn’t…then each person has to communicate the growth they achieved and the other has to re-internalize what the other externalized. Both of you work together to maximize the amount of one’s externalization that leads to the other’s growth and maximize the amount of internalization of one’s truth. You don’t want to externalize your own truth because then you won’t get growth. If you make someone else responsible for your pain by externalizing them and not allowing them to reject it and re-externalize it back to you by cheating on them, dissociating, breaking up, using anger to get them to repress it, whatever the case, you won’t grow out of that pain. Again, the difference between someone searching for a narcissistic counterpart and someone looking for growth is COMMUNICATION. Regardless of which of these 2 options your partner is searching for, they are going to hurt you the EXACT SAME WAY. The only difference is are they capable of choosing growth, i.e. noticing how they’ve hurt you, caring that they’ve hurt you, truly accepting your communication of the impact they have had and seeking to take precise and accurate and full responsibility for it, and implementing a true change. The implementation of a true change makes the other stuff apparent. If they have the other stuff then they will truly change. If they don’t then they will continue to hurt you over and over, or they will hide their behavior from you. Communication of where one is to their partner about how their behavior into the dynamic is being affected by their pain is ABSOLUTELY KEY TO DETERMINING IF THEY ARE A GROWTH MATCH.   \\n',\n",

I don’t care who someone is, I care that they know who they are; that they care that I know who they are because they respect my rights to keep myself safe (responsibility); and I care that they know and communicate where they are going. Paradoxically, emotional empathy isn’t a skill that grows in the decrease of one’s emotional darkness. It grows in how much of the darkness they are able to communicate to someone who would otherwise make choices that lead them to damaging themselves if that darkness is hidden from them. The ability to communicate comes from the knowing that damaging someone else with your darkness actually damage you are causing yourself—that knowledge is my definition of empathy. If you can’t communicate the darkness someone needs to hear, then you need to leave because either they aren’t safe to communicate to or they aren’t safe to be with you. If you pit someone’s survival in society on anything then the culture will orient their growth to maximize survival. That’s how the human brain is programmed to work. Capitalism pits it against money and so we created monsters as a result. If you pit it against emotional empathy then people/culture will orient to maximize emotional empathy I wrote about this idea a year ago. The economy needs not to dismantle capitalism but rather bring about a new economics that exists orthogonally to but cohesively with capitalism with its own distinct currency. One that brings capitalism into balance, like the legislative branch is meant to bring the executive branch into balance. Judicial, legislative and executive are meant to be orthogonal to and cohesive with each other. Capitalism aids in advancing society technologically: technological empathy if you will. Emotional coin would be given to those who advance emotional empathy in society. The problem is evolution hasn’t yet created an emotionally aware species so emotional empathy is ethereal to us as if we are making it up in our heads and so we wouldn’t know how to create or distribute such a currency. If you give a cat an iPhone 14 and a 1990’s Nokia, they won’t be able to tell you which one is better for society…but EVERY HUMAN would pick the iPhone 14 and THAT creates economy—a shared technological perspective on reality. In the world of emotion “tech” you could give a human an advanced form of emotional empathy and an inferior form of emotional empathy and they wouldn’t be able to tell you which is better for society so a shared emotional reality can’t be created and so no emotional economy makes sense to us. It’s complicated shit ;). To give you another example, our selfish instinct led to monarchy’s and dictatorships. Then we developed a form of societal empathy, realizing that a government for the people by the people has a better chance at flourishing. We didn’t abolish monarchism, we just balanced it by electing someone to be the “king” or “queen” for 4 years, and then balancing their “executive” power with orthogonal but cohesive dimensions of power: legislative and judicial. Capitalism is a dictatorship/monarchy of sorts. When we finally develop another form of societal empathy, capitalism will be updated with something that keeps the necessary parts of capitalism (free market and choice) but doesn’t rule us and instead serves the needs of society. Any socialist country :). Tax is an economy of its own currency that was meant to be orthogonal (independent power) yet cohesive with capitalism. The currency being the assurance of life necessities: health care, education, safety, voice, etc. But like you were saying yesterday, greed allowed by capitalism has used the power of the dollar to subjugate the power of government currency such that that currency is now heavily associated with the power of the dollar. So if you want good health care or good education or adequate safety or a loud voice, you have to go through capitalism and it rewards you with the power of the dollar. But we clearly can’t rely on government which is why we need to implement independent currencies directly into the economy, decentralized so that there isn’t a middle man. \\n',\n",
       " 'Definitely agree! In my life, what feels like darkness  is only what I haven’t yet chosen myself to be or not be. It’s what I am that I haven’t chosen from intelligence. For example, the instinct someone might have to be sexually monogamous by resisting/dissociating from temptation may seem like emotional empathy but it’s just as much darkness as someone who instinctually cheats by giving into temptation. The damage they  do to the other is a different story, of course. Exactly. That’s why I have a “you can cheat whenever you want as long as you communicate the darkness where it came from” policy in my relationships, not because I want the freedom to cheat (which is what all women first think 😂) but because I want someone’s darkness to have a home in the dynamic as well as their light. And sometimes you have to walk into the dark room to find the light switch and I don’t want to lose a person whose intent is to search for the light simply because they had to walk into the darkness to find it. Yes Yes Yes!!! Couldn’t agree more and it’s so hard to find in the world, so fucking impossible. Some people hide the darkness even from themselves. I can’t tell you how much I have written about this topic alone and came to the conclusion that I would choose someone with darkness that they properly communicate with the intent of bringing light to it over someone with a TON of light that hides even just a small amount of darkness.

       " 'Yes you are but you’re mixing sensitivity with reactivity. Think of sensitivity as how good your vision is, not how it reacts to bright light. Sensitivity is how much quality information you can bring into your awareness. Reactivity is how intense you react to that information. The world to you is like being in a dark room and then walking out into the sunlight. Your reactivity hides your true sensitivity until your eyes adjust to the light. This is why I say when you heal you become super intelligent in a way you never were before: your eyes stop being reactive to the light and start being receptive of it. Reactivity creates instinctual response. Sensitivity allows you to first see the information and then choose what to do which is intelligence. Instinct doesn’t let you see the information, it merely reacts to it. Better said, a cat that casts a shadow 10 times its size doesn’t make it a lion. This is why I say when you heal you become super intelligent in a way you never were before: your eyes stop being reactive to the light and start being receptive of it. Grow your awareness of your sensitivity. When you are reacting stop and ask “what is the information I am reacting to” and then try to figure out what it is you are actually seeing. The clearer you see, the more choice you get in your response. Just because a person casts a 20 foot shadow against the ground doesn’t mean they are a 20 foot monster.

We naturally understand the murder is wrong because there is a desire to hide one’s murderous actions. Animals do not hide their murder instinct, humans do. So we have a selfish sense of how our choice to murder can ultimately lead to damaging our own self: and that is empathy.

       " 'Currency is power. Power that is singular is a monarchy or dictatorship. Capitalism is a singular power because it has a singular currency and so it controls all people seeking that currency. Adding orthogonal but cohesive dimensions of economies with their own currency, there own type of power becomes a democracy if chosen by the people, otherwise it’s just an extension of the monarchy and so not truly orthogonal. The power of the dollar is a dictatorship, and it needs to be brought into checks and balances through other currency. If the dollar is misbehaving like the rich with money are hoarding power then as a government or people we drop the power of the dollar and increase the power of the other currency to make other people rich who aren’t hoarding the money. The way to punish the rich is to switch currencies to something they don’t own a lot of and have it be driven by the people. The more currencies the more power, just like other countries do this on their political system where they have multiple parties that have power instead of the 2-party system we have in the US which is not intelligence but rather instinct cause now they just mirror each other to create distinction. So an economy/government/political/philosophy/science system  needs at least 3-dimensions of power to become intelligence. No wonder we live in 3D space and not 2D. No wonder we have executive, judicial and legislative branches. No wonder we have physical, psychological and emotional awareness to be intelligent. We therefore need a 3rd party to become an intelligence political system.

       " 'True intelligence is not predictable no matter how much external information one has. When we are raised into adulthood, we are our experiential intelligence which is instinct. Instinct is perfectly predictable if one knows the full environment that one is currently in and all environments they have been. So humans are AI, artificial intelligence, because we are fully predictable. AI is merely experiential intelligence just like humans. The difference between instinct and intelligence is choice. Human brains have gotten so complex that they are unable to fully predict other’s instinctual behavior as well as their own!! Because of this lack of awareness of predictability, we believe we are making choices, that we have free-will as if it is something inherent to evolution–it isn’t!! Our subconscious is incapable of anything but instinct. It will always make the same choice in any environment if most of the parameters in that environment are roughly the same. The subconscious being like this proves that every decision we make is predictable or else how would it be able to make any decision at all? The subconscious doesn’t have the ability to choose so if you were to give it two equal options it would not know what to do. It’s like a ball on a floor with no friction will always roll in whatever direction gravity is flowing, and if it is equally flowing in all directions then it is stuck and can’t move, it can’t decide. The subconscious always flows in the direction of emotional gravity as IT has been designed to feel those emotional gravity waves based on its interpretation of the environment and what that environment triggers in it. So the subconscious response is nothing more than a ball on a floor where the floor is constantly being tilted based on the external environment. The floor tilting is the subconscious reaction or interpretation or translation of the external environment into the brain. Both the reaction and the response are fully predictable. There is only one way the subconscious could have interpreted the environment and given that reaction there is only one way the ball is allowed to roll: always in the direction of rolling “down” the floor. So the subconscious responds and the environment changes and the floor tilts and the ball changes directions. The ball rolling creates changes in the floor tilting because the ball rolling results in expression into the awareness and the external environment which means the subconscious has new information to interpret. So the subconscious is AI. If it weren’t then it would be alive. The subconscious is no more alive, has no more choice, than a planet that follows the gravitational waves of its environment. Intelligence is choice, and the subconscious has absolutely 0 choice. Where the subconscious follows the emotional gravity of the world like an asteroid floating through space and then the precise path it takes, all the decisions and experiences, creates the conscious awareness, Intelligence reverses this. Intelligence realizes that emotional gravity isn’t like physical gravity in that it exists external to the physical bodies that obey it. Intelligence realizes that emotional gravity is created by the subconscious inside the brain. The awareness is a body subjected to the subconscious universe created for the awareness to live in and the awareness obeys its laws of gravity. The awareness is tricked into being stuck in the subconscious universe by not realizing it is in the subconscious universe and instead believing itself to be in physical reality which is not created by the subconscious: this is psychological awareness. But emotional awareness is the ability for the awareness to perceive itself separate but within the universe created for it by the subconscious (which is just a mirror of the world’s universe). Psychological awareness is the birth of awareness in the physical universe. Emotional awareness is the birth of awareness in the subconscious universe. Chemical awareness is the birth of awareness in the universe created by the emotional awareness utilizing the subconscious machinery. When one gains emotional awareness they realize that they are the god of their own universe, not the god of the physical universe but the god of the subconscious universe. Intelligence puts a stop to all outside driven emotional gravity and creates its own gravity. It’s like that floor tilting, handheld game with a ball that rolls around and avoids holes in the floor. Not having emotional awareness is like you as a child getting that game for Christmas and all the adults inadvertently overpower your desires to play and pick up the game to play it themselves and you watch the ball roll according to the way they tilt the floor and so you become the ball (because that’s the point of the game, to follow the ball) but you aren’t in control of the ball, someone else is. So you are watching YOUR ball (because it’s your Christmas present) roll according to the laws of emotional gravity created by someone else that isn’t you. Emotional awareness is coming into your power and taking back what is yours, what is your gift, and being the person who decides who and when gets to play YOUR game. Note: this happened once to me when an older boy, Travis, the son of one of my mom’s friends was over for Christmas and I got some kind of video game console that he was excited about and then he hooked it up and played it and I just watched him play it. But first, you want to play it, learn how to play it, learn to get good at it. If you give it to someone else to play while you’re still learning then you are losing time to learn it yourself and after all you were given the game to learn it. Only once you’ve learned it does the cost-benefit ratio from letting someone else learn to play it work out in your favor because you have become an expert and so nothing is lost by letting someone else play and you can find someone who is also an expert in their game and you can learn each other’s games and learn how to co-create emotional gravity in an emotional dynamic. But the point is, emotional awareness is reclaiming the creator, god, role of the emotional gravity in your world and no longer being the ball but being the person controlling the ball. Until you are the person controlling the ball, you are the ball in someone else’s emotional reality. So the awareness was created by evolution to singularize the human experience, to not be a product of physical reality, but to create something that can make physical reality a product of itself. Evolution is driving to create both physical connection and physical disconnection, ie separate body from awareness as much as possible. Make the awareness more and more and more aware of its existence in physical reality but also more and more and more aware that it has another deeper existence not in physical reality. So intelligence allows the awareness to expand into becoming the god, the creator, of its own emotional reality. But intelligence must be created and organized and predictable but only predictable to the awareness, not to anyone else. True intelligence is only predictable to the person expressing from true intelligence. To gain predictability and organization one must practice and practice and practice the game and make decisions. The completion of intelligence is when you control the game without even needing to think and you complete the game without falling into one of the holes. The particular placement of the holes and the walls that are on the game are our balance equation of cohesion–the design of our true consciousness. The actual game I’m describing has an exact, optimal solution such that given a set of movements that completes the game, this set of movements if applied exactly on the exact same original game that those movements were created will complete the game every single time. Each copy of this game has a different set of holes and walls and length and size, etc. even if just slightly. So each person who buys this game has to find a unique set of movements that complete their game. If they try these set of movements on someone else’s version of the game then it will not complete the game, to varying degrees. So our true consciousness, our balance equation of cohesion, is specifically designed to force our awareness to learn particular movements, to create a specific intelligence that’s created from those movements. Its these movements that we add to the world, perhaps because we are part of a gigantic version of this game where each life form is in charge of a specific portion of the game like a relay race and at the end of time we will have generated all the true intelligence required to collectively roll the ball from the beginning of the game to the end without rolling into one of the holes. Narcissits have no use in this game, neither do false egos, because they try to take over someone else’s game and if they are entrusted to roll the ball in someone else’s area they will roll it into a hole. Only awarenesses built from true egos will have the Intelligence necessary to not fail. Perhaps multiple awarenesses (life forms) belong to a single area and collectively they combine to create the full intelligence of a single portion of this game which represents a single true life form in full reality, who knows. But what is clear is that awarenesses with false egos will never be allowed to touch this game for they have no intelligence to add. So it will take time for each awareness to build the true ego. The true ego is the set of movements that solve their game every single time. It’s the mirroring of the consciousness, ie the recipe of movements that if that recipe is all you saw you could easily see where the holes and the walls are in their game because it’s a one-to-one mapping. The true ego is the mirror mapping of the consciousness into physical reality. The true ego is the mapping of true intelligence into physical movements (psychology and body and thought) into physical reality, thereby transferring true intelligence into a world nearly devoid of it, a world that is deterministic and predictable where the only unpredictability is randomness at best and that’s not intelligence, that’s just noise. There is an unpredictability from the perspective of full physical reality that is a result of intelligence like a latent variable in statistics. That is what we are meant to pump physical reality with…a replacement of unpredictability with intelligence, not noise. So anyway, true intelligence to full physical reality is unpredictable and so it is true choice, and is the creation of true free-will from within physical reality. Whether it’s true choice or true free-will in full reality is in question but in physical reality it is true choice. Point is, until we find these movements for our game we are instinct only where our ball’s movements are at the whim of physical reality, not our own choice, even though it looks like choice because we can’t predict how our ball will roll. True intelligence you should be able to predict yourself but no one else can. If you can’t predict your own instinct perfectly then you do not have true choice. True choice goes against evolution, halts instinct, accepts information but chooses reaction to it. AI will never be able to be created by us in a way that can create true intelligence. The concept of AI is a misnomer because we make the assumption that humans are intelligent and we are building electricity capable of artificially creating that intelligence. But humans are predictable AI just in another form. In other words, if we wanted to build true AI all we need to do is map out the fundamental mathematics that was applied to organic chemistry to create human AI and then apply it to electricity and poof we have human in electricity form. AI isn’t human coded into electricity, it’s a fundamental logic or mathematics that when applied to organic chemistry creates chemical AI (humans) and when applied to electricity creates electricity AI. True intelligence comes from a logic, a mathematics, written in a language that can’t be read or spoken directly by or into physical reality, it can only be translated into physical reality. This is what humans are meant to be the AI of and that would make us different from the AI that we create, but alas we are of the AI we create. If we were of this true intelligence based AI then we would never be able to create AI because we wouldn’t be able to code the source of true intelligence. Instinctual/Experiential AI     \\n',\n",

This is a result of a lack of offensive boundaries on the part of the person who is allowing their ego to face outward to your empathy, and a lack of defensive boundaries on the part of the person who is allowing their empathy to face outward to other’s ego….EXCEPT when the person with empathy facing outward is choosing it from intelligence, not instinct (people pleasing) and not a mirror of instinct (to try to appear empathetic). But no human can choose this indefinitely, even a parent to a child. At some point the choice becomes a resistance to instinct and becomes a religion…like you were giving them time to change and they didn’t but you’ve invested more in that time making it easier to give more and more time. At some point, it no longer becomes intelligent and your body now starts mirroring instinct to achieve the same outward behavior of giving time but now there is a bi-product (it’s like how certain storage of energy has no bi-product but when you run out of that fuel source you start using a different fuel source whose conversion to energy has a bi-product of lactic acid). The instinct has now become the intelligent option so to keep the relationship you start mirroring the instinct but you can’t do something unintelligent in awareness so you have to blind yourself to the intelligent choice to leave or boundary them. Whereas before you were suppressing boundaries or leaving the person, now has the bi-product of repressed awareness. So you’ve split your awareness into what your observer is aware of and a piece that is repressed from the observer. Now, there is no true repression, there is only a redirection of expression. So the hidden awareness is going to express no matter what and you’ve chosen as the observer not to be aware of this expression: the observer can repress or express but the awareness can ONLY express. There are two places an awareness can express itself: internally and externally. So the hidden awareness is now a separate entity, a multiple personality of sorts, likely a skill allowed by schizophrenia, so while your unhidden awareness may be expressing externally, the hidden awareness is going to either express inwardly or outwardly underneath and out of the purview of the unhidden awareness. If the hidden awareness expressed outwardly then the observer will see this expression but won’t now where it is coming from because it is being expressed underneath the unhidden awareness. So this might look like being irritable, low energy, pulling away, becoming sick, not emotionally connected during sex, not making plans, expressing stress more, worsening sleep, no longer interested in personal hobbies, getting mad at your partner, psychoanalyzing your partner in harsh ways because you believe they must be causing this reaction in you, etc. Whatever the case, your observer is aware of your change of behavior but is unsure why. If you express inwardly your observer is aware of the changes as well and this would look like the opposite response so people pleasing more, walking on egg shells, becoming more quiet, cheating, lying, hiding, not communicating to partner, accepting all blame, no longer getting angry, being more apologetic, bending over backward–this is the hidden awareness expressing inward which creates a mirror image, an opposite force that expresses outward. And expressing outward creates an opposite force expressing inward. The reason is because to express NOT from one’s emotional truth means there is no true emotional gravity with which to push out an expression or prevent an expression (suppression), there is no intelligence which carries its own emotional gravity, so one has to create a zero-sum force to create the illusion of intelligence externally but hiding the internal reaction that created the force. So someone has to create a force that goes external and internal, ie an equal and opposing force. It’s like if you are floating in space completely still and you have a soccer ball you want to get to someone. Then the act of pushing the soccer ball toward that person pushes you backward by the same force–this is instinct. If however the pushing of the soccer ball is an intelligent decision then the soccer ball is already moving toward the person and all you have to do is choose to let it go by you–this is intelligence. If you, however, mirror instinct–which is not intelligence–meaning you’re resisting something intelligent as if to resist temptation which means there is true emotional gravity and so the soccer ball is moving then you would effectively catch the soccer ball and then its force would now dislodge you from your position and you would float to the person. So religion which is a resistance of temptation is the act of instead of keeping yourself center you resist temptation and take yourself off center from who you are and you float away to someone else instead of the soccer ball. We are all in a giving location not moving at all and this represents our true self location which is where we want to stay at all time, and our job is to never catch a soccer ball whether it’s coming from behind us or coming toward us, nor ever redirect one or push one that isn’t moving because any of these acts has the effect of pushing ourselves off center. If we get pushed off center then we need to start catching and redirecting soccer balls in order to get ourself back to our true self and this can get to be a complicated math problem. Imagine we are all stationary in space, billions of us and soccer balls are stationary every where such that they are right in front of us but to change their location because of ego people redirect them to get where they want and this causes other people to have to catch a soccer ball and then they try to get back to center by pushing that soccer ball in a different direction which offsets another person. It doesn’t take long for this wave of chaos to flow throughout all billions of people such that we are now all off center, throwing soccer balls at each other in a direction opposite of where we think we need to move to get back to center. Now we have a complicated Rubik’s cube math problem to get us all back to center and to get back to a zero energy state everywhere rather than a total zero-sum energy state. So we hurt people, take them off center to get ourselves back to center. We allow ourselves to get hurt because we were abused into not being allowed to throw soccer balls. We allow ourselves to be unaware of the soccer balls we push toward other people (sociopaths) but avoid all soccer balls thrown at us. Any time we choose something that is instinctual and not intelligent, something that doesn’t come for our emotional truth, we have to create equal an opposite energy flow: one external and one internal to sum to zero. So in the case of the hidden awareness, if it expresses the damage, the bi-product, the lactic acid outward then one will hurt their partner as a result of their own choice to ignore doing the intelligent option, and this creates an equal opposite expression that pushes you away from the dynamic, from the person since that is the true form of the energy. Your behavior coming from the hidden awareness expressing outwardly is an attempt to push them away from you so that you do not lose center and you get out of the dynamic which is narcissistic, not taking responsibility for the person who knows the intelligent decision. The more you resist the more powerful that expression becomes and eventually breaks the dynamic to make sure you don’t lose connection to self but you end up pushing them more off center as a result and now transferring responsibility to the dynamic to make a choice that is intelligent to a responsibility to them for pushing them off center ultimately leading to you being pushed off center because you pushed a soccer ball to them so that they would move out of the dynamic: though if you have good intent, they do the same thing which is what Meghan did to counteract my ego/narcissism by expressing outwardly in the dark–her behavior SAVED me from being responsible from pushing her off center. If you express inwardly then you are pushing your core self away to stay in the same place relative to the person, ie constant self abandonment. But when it’s emotional truth you can make intelligent decisions without moving off center because you don’t have to provide the energy to make those decisions–you just follow gravity. Creating your own false gravity through resisting one’s emotional truth has detrimental effects. One’s emotional truth creates gravity with respect to those you are in a dynamic with and this gravity tells you how, how fast, at what angle to move toward them relative to all other emotional gravity sources. Intelligence is being aware of the gravitational fields of one’s emotional truth vs one’s psychological needs. Psychological needs creates instinct and does not often lead in the same direction as the emotional gravitation field. If one follows the psychological gravitational field, often directed by dopamine and norepinephrine, then they will self-abandon their emotional truth which is what one would choose to be versus the experiences that made them into who they are. Emotional truth is the gravitational fields that lead us back to our center that we were displaced from due to the experiences, the psychological gravity fields that were created for us, creating an awareness of self that had a perspective on the self and its place in the world from a location not aligned with their emotional truth. So when you switch your method of travel to be that of emotional gravity and stay true to that, that emotional gravity will always flow you back to the center of one’s emotional truth. Even if you make mistakes by following psychological gravity, your emotional gravity fields will be altered. In other words, there is always a path back to one’s emotional truth center via following the emotional gravity fields that come into one’s life. You will never be led astray. Things will be brought into your life to continue back to one’s center.   \\n',\n",
